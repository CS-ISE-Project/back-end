        "abstract": "In this study, a novel singleended primary inductor (SEPIC) converterbased fuzzy logic controller for maximum power point tracking is presented. By adding rules to the perturb and observing search strategy, the new controller enhances it while fuzzifying and removing its flaws. When compared to traditional maximum power point tracking techniques, fuzzy logic trackers enable an accurate and quick convergence to maximum power point under both steadystate and variable weather situations. The performance of the proposed maximum power point tracker is demonstrated in simulation."

        "1. Circuit for a PV array": ". The following equations provide the output current: I = Iph ID (1) I = Iph I0 [exp ( q(V+RsI) AKBT ) 1] V+RsI Rsh (2) Iph Photo current A Ideality factor KB Constant of Boltzmann T Cell temperature ID Current via a diode Rs Series resistance I0 Current of Saturation q Electronic charge Rsh Shunt resistance V Cell voltage I Current of cell The shunt resistance (Rsh) is typically orders of magnitude larger than the series resistance (Rs) [6]. Therefore, it is common for the shunt and series resistances of a solar cell can be neglected to simplify the model. The resulting ideal voltage current characteristic of the solar cell is given by equation (3). I = Iph I0 [e(qV KT) 1] (3) III. SEPIC CONVERTER Power electronics researchers are working hard to create DC DC converters with simpler designs and greater efficiency [7]. To maintain a constant output voltage, the suggested DCtoDC converter employs a singleended primaryinductor converter (SEPIC) architecture. The SEPIC converter is made up of a duty cycle switch S, a diode, two inductors (L1 and L2), two capacitors (C1 and C2), and a load resistor. Figure 2 depicts the circuit diagram of a SEPIC converter. A SEPIC is a DCDC converter [8]. SEPIC are DCDC converters that can output voltages that are B, larger than, or equal to the input voltage. The duty cycle of the control transistor affects the SEPIC converter's output voltage. The SEPIC converter is two converters in one: a boost converter followed by a buckboost converter. It has the advantages of having a noninverted output (the output voltage has the same polarity as the input voltage) , using a series capacitor to couple energy from the input to the output (which makes it more responsive to shortcircuits), and being able to shut down completely: when the switch \"S\" is turned off, the output voltage drops to 0 V, accompanied by a significant transient discharge of charge. Fig.",
        "2. Simple circuit diagram of the SEPIC converter": "Figure 3 depicts the circuit when the power switch is switched on and off (in Figures a and b, respectively). Figure 3a When the switch is on, the first inductor, L1 is charged from the input voltage source. The second inductor L2 absorbs energy from the first capacitor C1, leaving the output capacitor C2 to supply the load current. Fig. 3.a. The switch turned on. Fig. 3.b. The switch turned off. Fig.",
        "3. Equivalent circuit diagram of the SEPIC converter": "when the switch is on and off. When the switch is turned on, the input inductor is charged from the source, and the second inductor is charged from the first capacitor. No energy is supplied to the load capacitor during this time. The inductor current and capacitor voltage polarities are marked in this Figure. When the power switch is turned off, the energy stored in the inductor is transferred. The energy stored is transferred through the diode and supplies the energy to the load [10], as shown in Figure 3. b. The second inductor is also connected to the load during this time. The output capacitor sees a pulse of current during the off time, making it inherently noisier than a buck converter. The amount that the SEPIC converters increase or decrease the voltage depends primarily on the duty cycle and the parasitic elements in the circuit. The output of an ideal SEPIC converter is: Vout = D 1D Vin (4) A SEPIC converter is to process the electricity from the PV system. This converter either increases or decreases the PV system voltage at the load. The proposed SEPIC converter operates in buck mode. IV. FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL In the fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm, the voltage and current at each instant k are measured to calculate the active power. The active power is then compared with the power at the previous instant (k1) to obtain the change in power (\u0394P(k)). Similarly, the voltage at instant k is compared with the voltage at instant k1 to obtain the voltage error (\u0394V(k)) [11]. The power error is then divided by the current error to obtain the error (E). The error is then compared with the previous error to calculate the change in error (\u0394E(k)). The error (E(k)) and the change in error (\u0394E(k)) are then used as the crisp inputs to the fuzzy logic controller. The flow chart for the fuzzy logic MPPT algorithm is shown in Figure",
        "4. In this work, the Mamdani inference technique, A": "type membership functions, and a 25element rule base were used for the fuzzy logic control. The Mamdani inference technique is efficient and straightforward in defining the fuzzy output sets, and it is more popular among researchers than other inference techniques [12]. The Atype or triangular membership function is used because it is simpler to split into low and high membership functions (MFs) than other membership functions. Additionally, it has been observed that the triangular membership function has a faster response and less overshoot than other functions [13]. A 25element rule base was used because it has been shown to perform well [14][15]. Fig.",

CONCLUSIONS This paper presents the design of an offgrid photovoltaic system with a fuzzy logic MPPTcontrolled pushpull boost converter. The proposed system was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and tested under various weather conditions. The results showed that the fuzzy logic algorithm outperformed the conventional algorithms in terms of MPPT accuracy and minimization of fluctuations, regardless of rapid changes in irradiance."
