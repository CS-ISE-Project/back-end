Although the general concept of OSM does not prescribe speci\ufb01c sets of views, a concrete OSM environment has to be speci\ufb01c about the particular views to be used in a particular project. At the University of Mannheim we are developing a prototype OSM environment, nAOMi, that supports the views de\ufb01ned by the KobrA 2.0 method, a version of KobrA adapted for OSM. In this paper we provide an overview of the KobrA 2.0 metamodel underpinning nAOMi and give a small example of its use to model a software system."

        "1. INTRODUCTION": "Orthographic Software Modeling (OSM) is based on three fundamental hypotheses (a) that it is feasible to inte grate the many di\ufb00erent kinds of artifacts used in contempo rary software engineering methods within a single coherent methodology in which they are treated as views, (b) that it Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the \ufb01rst page.

Figure 1: Orthographic Projection. As shown in Figure 1, the main advantages of using the idea of orthographic projection to de\ufb01ne the views used to visualize and described a system are that they (a) can be organized according to a simple and easytounderstand metaphor and (b) collectively represent all the properties of a system with minimal overlap and redundancy. In practice this translates into a set of dimensions, each containing well de\ufb01ned choices (or so called dimension elements) that can be used to select individuals views. As shown in Figure 2, the main advantage of making the artifacts used to describe a software system views of a SUM is that the number of pairwise coherence relationships that have to be maintained is reduced and new views can be in troduced by simply de\ufb01ning their relationship to the SUM. Moreover, the importance of this advantage grows quickly as the size of the system and the complexity of the deployed development methodology increase. Another important ad vantage is that the dominance of one particular kind of view over the development process (e.g. code) at the expense of other kinds of views (e.g. graphical models) is reduced so that any appropriate type of views can be used to enrich the underlying description of the system, depending on the needs and skills of the stakeholder involved. This makes it possible to subsume all view types under the same, overarch SUM SUM / View Centric Environment Artifact / Tools Centric Environment Figure 2: Consistency Dependencies in Artifactoriented versus Vieworiented Environments. ing development process and methodology (e.g. agiledriven, focusing on small development cycles, or modeldriven de velopment, based on transformations between abstraction levels). Although the details of how the views are created from the SUM and how the SUM is updated from the views are not central to the approach, a natural implementation is to use the visualization and transformation technologies o\ufb00ered by model driven software engineering (MDSE). To explore the validity of these hypotheses at the Uni versity of Mannheim we have been developing a prototype OSM modeling environment based on an enhanced version of the KobrA method for modeldriven, componentoriented development, KobrA 2.0 [1]. This was chosen as a basis for the prototype, known as the Open, Adaptable, Orthographic Modeling Environment (nAOMi) [13] because its views were designed with the precise goals of being (a) genuine pro jections of a subject containing carefully selected subsets of information about that subject, (b) minimalistic in the sense that they should overlap to the smallest extent possible and contain the minimum necessary models elements, and (c) selectable via a set of independent dimensions which re\ufb02ect di\ufb00erent fundamental concerns of development (i.e. abstraction levels, composition or variants). In other words, KobrA already provided one of the most orthogonal sets of views for visualizing software systems of any contempo rary method. More details about the actual views and di mensions de\ufb01ned in KobrA are presented in the following sections. More information on OSM can be found in [2] and [3]. nAOMi is implemented as an Eclipse plugin using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) as the underlying mod eling platform and UML 2.0 tools [4] to generate and edit views. The KobrA 2.0 metamodel on which the current version of nAOMi is based is a specialization of the UML metamodel composed of three separate packages one for the SUM, one for the views and one for the transformations (Figure 3). The UML was chosen as the base language be cause of its maturity and widespread acceptance, making the environment usable to the largest possible body of develop ers. UML elements not needed in KobrA 2.0 are excluded using OCL constraints while new elements or properties are KobrA2 Transformation SUM Views Figure 3: KobrA",

The unique contribution of this paper is to elaborate on the structure of the KobrA 2.0 metamodel and how it is used to drive nAOMi. The three following sections each focus on one of the three main components of the metamodel the SUM, the views and the transformations . This is followed by a brief overview of the OSM navigation paradigm in Sec tion 5 before a small example of the approach is presented in Section 6. Section 7 then concludes the paper with related and future work.",
        "2. SUM PACKAGE": "Figure 4 depicts the internal structure of the SUM pack age which is based on the UML metamodel. There are three main subpackages, two containing the structural and behav ioral constructs respectively, and one containing the con straints that ensure that the metaclasses are used according to the KobrA conventions and rules. The Classes subpackage of the Structure package contains some of the most fundamental elements of the KobrA meta model, such as Class and ComponentClass. The internal structure of this package is illustrated in Figure 5. Com ponentClass represents objects with complex and reusable behaviors, while Class captures simple data type objects that have only very simple or nonreusable behaviors. The modeler has to decide whether it is necessary to model a speci\ufb01c part of the system as a ComponentClass and include state charts and activity diagrams, or whether it is su\ufb03cient to use a Class (which is limited to using OCL constraints). ComponentClass inherits (indirectly via Class) from Com munications so it also has the isActive attribute. This makes KobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Behavioral KobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Structural KobrA2::SUM::Constraint KobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Common KobrA2::SUM::Behavior::ProtocolStateMachines KobrA2::SUM::Behavior::Common KobrA2::SUM::Behavior::Activities KobrA2::SUM::Behavior::Actions KobrA2::SUM::Behavior KobrA2::SUM::Structure::Classes KobrA2::SUM::Structure::Types KobrA2::SUM::Structure::Instances KobrA2::SUM::Structure::Elements KobrA2::SUM::Structure KobrA2::SUM::Constraint::OclExpressions merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge Figure 4: KobrA",

Active objects, which can be used to model threads and processes ([8] p. 438), start to execute their behavior as soon as they are created and perform operations spontaneously. A ComponentClass may exhibit complex behavior. In Ko brA, this behavior may be speci\ufb01ed in the form of UML State Diagrams (de\ufb01ning acceptable operation invocation sequences), and in the form of Activities (de\ufb01ning algorithms of operations). UML Interaction elements (in sequence dia grams) can be derived from the activity elements and thus are not included in the SUM. As KobrA aims to facilitate automatic checking of allowed sequences of operation calls, Protocol State Machines are supported instead of general state machines. Since the latter include a large variety of elements not needed for specifying acceptable operation se quences or automatic checking, OCL constraints are used to prohibit the use of unwanted features. context ComponentClass only allow Activity elements or ProtocolStateMachines inv: ownedBehavior forAll( oclIsKindOf( Actitivity) or oclIsKindOf ( ProtocolStateMachine )) For example, since KobrA has no concept of roles for com ponents, the use of role also needs to be prohibited. The part association refers to owned properties of components whose attribute isComposite is true. As KobrA uses associations like nests and creates for components, part, required and provided are not needed. Connectors (i.e. delegation and assembly) are not used in KobrA either so ownedConnector is excluded.

        "3. VIEWS PACKAGE": "The structure of the Views package is illustrated in Figure 6. Again, since most of the views de\ufb01ned in KobrA 2.0 are based on UML diagrams, the view metamodels have similar elements to the SUM metamodel. The big di\ufb00erence to the SUM is that there are no restrictions on the use of the view metamodel elements. For instance, views for a particular purpose such as supporting model checkers can be supported by adding elements unrelated to the UML. The substructure of the Views package re\ufb02ects the types and organization of the KobrA views according to the view dimensions supported in nAOMi (cf. example in Section 6). At the top level, the Views package is thus decomposed into the Speci\ufb01cation and Realization options of the encap sulation dimension. These, in turn are both decomposed into the Structural, Behavioral and Operational options of the Projection dimension. Finally, with the exception of the behavioral option, these are also all subdivided into the Service and Type options of the granularity dimension. This dimension, with its two options, is an addition to the original version of KobrA. The Service view shows the direct, publicly visible rela tionships of the subject ComponentClass to other Compo nentClasses, while the Type view shows the publicly visi ble relationships of the subject to simple Classes. As with the SUM, constraints have been de\ufb01ned to control what can go into each view and when they are well formed. For ev ery view, a constraint enumerates all allowed elements (not shown in this paper). In the following, some of the other constraints for the Service view are elaborated. Since this view is a blackbox view, the internals of ComponentClasses (nestedClassi\ufb01er) are not shown. context ComponentClass no nested classifiers , no protocol inv: nestedClassifier union(protocol)isEmpty () Classes are only allowed if they are generalizations of Com ponentClasses, (or any of its superclasses, since a Compo nentClass may inherit from a class as shown in the con straints with context Class. The following invariants ensure that only publicly visible attributes and operations are in this view, for both classes and ComponentClasses (which inherit from Class).

        "4. TRANSFORMATIONS PACKAGE": "The package AllViews provides the foundation for speci fying the transformations between the SUM and the views in both directions. Part of the packages contents are shown in Figure 7. The Abstraction concept (which is in fact a KobrA2::Transformation::Common::AllViews Abstraction TransformationExpression ViewElement SumElement View KobrA2::SUM::Structure::Elements::Element KobrA2::Views::ConcreteSyntax::Element KobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Behavioral::Exp ressionInOcl KobrA2::Views::Subject::View {subsets mapping} 0..1 0..1 {subsets clientDependency} +abstraction 1 {subsets client} +ve 1 1..* 1 {subsets supplier} +se 1 {subsets supplierDependency} +abstraction 1..* Figure 7: Transformation abstractions. dependency reused from the UML but with additional con straints) plays the key role in relating elements from the SUM to elements of a view. Abstraction is actually mapped to ExpressionInOcl. When appearing in transformations, the equals sign links elements in the SUM to the respective elements in the view, and vice versa. For instance, equal ity of the general metaassociation of a Generalization in a transformation invariant means that, when following gen eral, there must be an element in the SUM and in the view for which similar transformation expressions are speci\ufb01ed. In the case of KobrA 2.0, which has many projections that just select a subset of elements using onetoone abstrac tions, this allows concise declarative TransformationExpres sions. Together with the view constraints, a CASE tool can be implemented which uses a transformation language of the implementors choice, for instance the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) [11] or QVT [9]. The role names se and ve are short for SumElement and ViewElement, respectively. These roles subset the client and supplier roles from the UML. SUM elements are translated into UML elements with stereotypes, so that the views are easy to manage for de velopers familiar with the UML. The bidirectional mappings between stereotyped view elements and nonstereotyped SUM elements are expressed in the constraints of the Association Abstraction, a subclass of the Abstraction from the AllViews package. This is also an example of a transformation which is reused in other views. context AssociationAbstraction inv: ve.memberEnd = se.memberEnd inv: ve.ownedEnd = se.ownedEnd ivn: ve. navigableOwnedEnd = se. navigableOwnedEnd inv: se. oclIsKindOf(Acquires) implies ve. hasStereotype (acquires ) inv: ve. hasStereotype (acquires ) implies se. oclIsKindOf (Aquires) inv: se. oclIsKindOf(Nests) implies ve. hasStereotype ( nests ) inv: ve. hasStereotype (nests ) implies se. oclIsKindOf (Nests) inv: se. oclIsKindOf (Creates) implies ve. hasStereotype (creates ) inv: ve. hasStereotype (creates ) implies se. oclIsKindOf (Creates) Figure 8 shows the main elements involved in the trans formation of the black box structural view for Component Classes. The \ufb01rst transformation constraint is on the view and declares the starting point for the transformation. It states that the subject ComponentClass and its generaliza tions (using a SUM utility function, superClosure) are in the view. The following transformation rules illustrate how to create the output (i.e. view) elements from the input (i.e. SUM) el ements, such as the publicly visible attributes and operations of the ComponentClass and the acquired ComponentClasses. The \ufb01rst constraint for ComponentClassAbstraction states that references to potential general classes (and Component Classes) of ComponentClasses are mirrored in the view. In addition, ComponentClasses will be shown with the corre sponding stereotypes. The ComponentClass owns various types of associations, so in this view only the acquires asso ciations are selected (whose transformation rules are cov ered in the common transformation packages).For classes and ComponentClasses, only publicly visible attributes and operations appear in the view. Class invariants are also copied. Classes that may appear in this view (e.g. as gener alizations of ComponentClasses) may have a powertype (role name powertypeExtent) which will be displayed. The last transformation statement copies the class refer ences of operations. As with all views, the transformation rules, the common transformation statements (which also cover operations) and the view constraints serve as a speci \ufb01cation for the implementation of a view. Individual CASE tools can use di\ufb00erent implementation techniques as long as they conform to the semantics of these rules and constraints.

Class invariants and potential powertypes and connections to the classes in this view are shown as well. There may also be Enumerations, for which the EnumerationLiterals are displayed.

        "5. NAVIGATION": "Most of todays tools use some combination of trees to organize the content of models as well as the views used to visualize a software system or component. In an any envi ronment incorporating a number of di\ufb00erent tools there is invariably a large number of di\ufb00erent trees storing a het erogeneous mix of artifacts including model elements (e.g. classes, instances, associations), diagrams (e.g. class dia grams, state diagrams) and other artifact types (source code, XML \ufb01les, con\ufb01guration \ufb01les ). To work with all the views in a traditional development environment, therefore, engineers typically have to learn about the organization structures of all the incorporated tools. In contrast to conventional paradigms for organizing and navigating the many views used to visualize a system, OSM employs the metaphor of a multidimensional cube. More speci\ufb01cally, as illustrated in Figure 9, OSM regards dimen sion of the underlying methodology as representing a di\ufb00er ent dimension of the cube, and each independently variable aspect of that dimension is a selectable dimension element. Selecting a view thus simply corresponds to selecting a single cell within the cube. In general, three types of dimensions are supported: static dimensions in which the number of Figure 9: Dimensionbased navigation. selectable elements (i.e. coordinates) is \ufb01xed, dynamic di mensions in which the number of elements is dynamic (i.e. derived from the SUM), and mixed dimensions which have both static and dynamic elements. To support the OSM dimension based navigation metaphor for KobrA, we de\ufb01ned the seven dimensions indicated on the left hand side of Figure 10 which is a sceenshot of nAOMI. The Abstraction dimension (not expanded here), which has three static dimension elements, PIM (platform independent model), PSM (platform speci\ufb01c model) and Code, captures the modeldriven development concern of KobrA. The ver sion dimension captures the state of the modeled system at speci\ufb01c points in time. The Component dimension, which has dynamic dimension elements de\ufb01ned by instances of the class ComponentClass in the SUM, captures the component based development concern of KobrA. The Encapsulation dimension, which has two \ufb01xed ele ments, supports the distinction between Speci\ufb01cation (black box) and Realization (white box) views of components, while the Projection dimension with the \ufb01xed elements Structural, Operational and Behavioral covers the di\ufb00erent information types. The Granularity dimension provides a \ufb01ner grained distinction between views describing the types used by com ponents (Type granularity) and views describing the required and provided interfaces (Service granularity). The Opera tion dimension allows a selection of individual operations. In the ideal case, when all views are truly orthogonal, the choices that can be made in each dimensions are completely independent. However, this is very di\ufb03cult to achieve in software engineering. The approach still works if the views are not completely orthogonal, but dependencies then occur between di\ufb00erent choices in di\ufb00erent dimensions, so that the decisions made in one dimensions may a\ufb00ect choices possi ble in another dimension. This is best handled by giving dimensions a precedence ranking determined by the order in which they appear (the top being the highest). When an element in a dimension is selected, the tool automatically makes default selections for dimensions of lower precedence (i.e. dimensions lower down) and disables selections that would navigate to cells (i.e. views) which are not (yet) de \ufb01ned by the method at hand.",
        "6. SHOPPING CART EXAMPLE": "To show how a software system can be speci\ufb01ed using nAOMi, this section presents a case study based on a shop ping cart system. A ShoppingCart component collects and Figure 10: Speci\ufb01cation Structural View. manages the products selected by users and supports pay ment via a credit card. Figure 10 illustrates a structural view of the component. In the dimension navigator on the left hand side, PIM was chosen for the Abstraction Level (not expanded in the screenshot). The second dimension is the state of the soft ware system at a certain point in time. The picture shows that the latest available version was chosen. As with every choice in a dimension, it may in\ufb02uence the options in lower ranked dimensions. The component under consideration is the ShoppingCart, for which a black box view is selected in the next dimension. After the user selects the structural projection option and the service level granularity, the tool automatically chooses the option for all operations in the last dimension, as there is no editor registered for the other options. The component under development is presented with the stereotype subject and its relationship to other components and classes is shown in the view, which corresponds to a cell of the multidimensional navigation cube, and is generated onthe\ufb02y from the SUM when it is selected. The classes Product and CreditCard can be used as data types in the operations of the component. Figure 11 illustrates the operational view in which an operation can be formalized using pre and postconditions. The precondition corresponds to the assumes clause in and the postcondition corresponds to the result clause. As in the UML, the precondition of an operation must be true when the operation is invoked and the postcondition must be true when the operation is \ufb01nished. The operation addProduct in Figure 11 must be in state CollectingProducts or Empty when invoked. This is also visible in the behavioral view, Figure 11: addProduct() Operation Speci\ufb01cation. since there are only two transitions with the operation ad dProduct. Both leads to the state CollectingProducts which is also a postcondition of the operation. The second post condition is that the cost attribute of the component must be increased by the price of the added product. The pre and postcondition can be expressed using the OCL. The proper ties of the component, states and operation parameters can be used to formalise the constraints like as in this example. Figure 12 shows the publicly visible behaviour of the Shop pingCart component with states and transitions. The condi tional transitions map to operations of the component. Like every view, this view is also synchronized with the SUM so that it is guaranteed that its operations, states and proper ties are consistent with those in the structural view. Figure 12: Speci\ufb01cation Behavioral Model. Although the operational view seems to be similar to the behavioral view because of the overlapping information within them, there are signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences. The focus of the op erational view is on a precise formal de\ufb01nition of an opera tion of a component. The operations can be enriched by pre and postconditions which can be de\ufb01ned using complex OCL statements, that formalize the complete behavior of an op eration. The additional information in the OCL statements can be used for code generation and documentation.",
        "7. CONCLUSION": "At the beginning of the paper we identi\ufb01ed three funda mental hypothesis upon which the notion of OSM is based (a) that it is feasible to integrate the many di\ufb00erent kinds of artifacts used in contemporary software engineering meth ods within a single coherent methodology in which they are treated as views, (b) that it is feasible to create an e\ufb03 cient and scalable way of supporting these views by gener ating them dynamically, onthe\ufb02y, from a Single Underly ing Model (SUM) using modelbased transformations and (c) that it is feasible to provide an intuitive metaphor for navigating around these many views by adapting the ortho graphic projection technique underpinning the CAD tools used in other engineering disciplines. The prototype tool, nAOMi, described in this paper rep resents the \ufb01rst step towards demonstrating the validity of these hypotheses and showing that OSM is a viable approach to software engineering. Of the three hypotheses, (a) and (c) are most convincingly demonstrated by the prototype, since it shows that it is indeed possible to support all the views of the KobrA method within a single navigation metaphor. The prototype tool does not demonstrate the validity of hy pothesis (b) to the same extent as the others due to its small size. Although it demonstrates the feasibility of gen erating views from the SUM and viceversa, the question of whether such an approach scales up to large environments is still open. Although nOAMi is the only tool developed with the spe ci\ufb01c aim of supporting KobrAbased OSM, several other tools and methods have similar properties or aims. For example, Glinz et al. [10] describe a tool with a \ufb01sheye zooming algorithm which lets the user view a model with varying amounts of detail depending on the context. It has to be investigated whether it is possible to combine the \ufb01sh eye zooming concept with the dimensionbased navigation paradigm. While the KobrA 2.0 implementation of nAOMi heavily uses UML diagrams for developers, Glinz et al. use custom diagram types, e.g. for structural and behavioral views. An approach which also emphasizes the description of for mal consistency rules (correspondences) between views is RMODP [5][6]. However, this approach does not explic itly mention the notion of a SUM and thus implies that consistency rules should be de\ufb01ned in a pairwise fashion be tween individual pairs of views. ArchiMate [7], which com plements TOGAF [12], is an enterprise architecture mod eling language which o\ufb00ers two orthogonal dimensions for modeling, (business, architecture, and technology) layers and (informational, behavioral and structural) aspects and also suggests two more dimensions, purpose and abstraction level. However, as many of these views span multiple choices of a singledimension, the intuitive dimensionbased navigation metaphor of OSM can not be easily applied. There are also more general approaches for viewbased modeling but they are less speci\ufb01c in terms of consistency rules between views and provide little guidance on how to manage and navigate views, for example the Zachman Framework [14]. Regarding the practical use of OSM environments in the future, the biggest challenge is developing appropriate SUM metamodels which can accommodate all the types of views and services that software engineers are accustomed to to day. For this \ufb01rst prototypical SUMbased environment sup porting the OSM approach we had a method at our disposal (KobrA) that already de\ufb01ned a full set of orthogonal UML based views. This allowed us to model the required SUM and view metamodels by simply adapting the UML meta models, removing and adding model elements as needed. In doing so we were able to manually ensure that the meta models ful\ufb01lled the two core requirements of SUMbased en vironments (1) being minimalistic and (2) redundancy free. If SUMbased software engineering environments are to take o\ufb00, and to be introduced into existing, heteroge neous environments, more sophisticated ways of integrating existing metamodels into a single uni\ufb01ed metamodel will be required. 8."
