    "abstract": "The rapid advances in technology over the last decade have significantly altered the nature of engineering knowledge and skills required in the modern industries. In response to the changing professional requirements, engineering institutions have updated their curriculum and pedagogical practices. However, most of the changes in the curriculum have been focused on the core engineering courses without much consideration for the auxiliary courses in mathematics and sciences. In this paper, we aim to propose a new, augmented mathematics curriculum aimed at meeting the requirements of the modern, technology-based engineering workplace. The proposed updates require minimal resources and can be seamlessly integrated into the existing curriculum.",
    "content": "introduction the industrial revolution has had a dramatic impact on the engineering the modern technologies such as artificial the internet of and advanced robotics have altered engineering systems and engineers are expected to be able to leverage these resources to produce their to meet the new professional engineering educational institutions have revised their the changes in the curricula include both updating the existing programs as well as introducing completely new given the rapid technological universities and colleges around the world are continuously adapting to the while a significant progress in modernizing the engineering curriculum has been there still remains room for catalyzed by the exponential increase in computational power and the modern industrial revolution has reshaped the skills and competencies required of the the changes in engineering curricula in response to industry have been modernizing the existing introduction of new and revising the pedagogical modernizing the existing programs involves introduction of new courses in the study plan related to emerging in existing courses can be updated with new fresh new programs in emerging technologies are also introduced by universities and many institutions now offer degrees in artificial intelligence and mechatronics which were not there years universities have revised their approaches to course and applied learning have become popular in the new engineering educational while significant effort has been made to revise the core engineering the auxiliary courses in mathematics and sciences received little the mathematics and sciences courses play a key role in the engineering given their the curriculum updates must also be extended to the auxiliary by implementing a comprehensive update of the engineering curriculum that includes both the core and auxiliary a more effective outcome can be the goal of this paper is to propose a modernized engineering mathematics curriculum in line with the broader efforts to update engineering education to adapt to industry the key feature of the new curriculum is the introduction numerical computing in the existing mathematics the latest industrial revolution has been driven largely by the dramatic increase in computational engineers must be to leverage the computing power in their since mathematics courses are usually taken at the beginning of the study it offers a natural avenue for introducing numerical computing to many problems in mathematics can be solved numerically making it natural to integrate numerical computing in mathematics by studying numerical computing in mathematics students will acquire the necessary theoretical and practical skills to apply in their specialized engineering this paper is structured as section provides an overview of the existing efforts to update the engineering curriculum in response to industry section discusses the current approaches to integrate scientific computing in mathematics in section we present our proposal for modernizing the mathematics curriculum to integrate numerical section concludes the paper with final engineering education and industry engineering departments in colleges and universities have made signi\ufb01cant changes in their curricula in response to the new environment created by the rapid advances in in the existing programs have been updated to include courses that target emerging completely new programs related to ai and mechatronics have also been adopted by innovations in the \ufb01eld of engineering education continue to take place with new developments on the there exist several studies investigating the modern gineering curricula and evaluating their it is argued in that engineering educators must prepare their students to face three key the industrial and the authors \ufb01nd that colleges and universities are responding to these challenges by emphasizing integration of theory and digital and online and the de\ufb01nition of professional in response to the needs of industry require interdisciplinary collaboration across several programs and interaction and integration of technologies plays a key role in this process terdisciplinary engineering education requires sound pedagogy and teaming experiences to encourage student in collaborative and interdisciplinary practice digital and online learning have become an important part of modern education including in the \ufb01eld of information technologies play a vital role in delivering digital learning to colleges and universities have made signi\ufb01cant investments to improve their information and munication technology capacities in response to the needs of industry some sities have adopted the framework of education the new education framework consists of four main learning and students competencies are based on technological knowledge and skills for successful workplace while the learning methods are based on problem solving and in active and learning plays an important role in education other innovative approaches to learning such as based engineering education can help improve the learning process related to industry in addition to technological shifts must be taken into account in revising engineering the new generation of students has its unique worldview which needs to be considered by the in the new generation is signi\ufb01cantly affected by mobile devices and digital educational content must be tailored to the new student preferences to achieve effective learning outcomes innovative approaches such gami\ufb01cation may help improve the learning process many universities have also introduced nontechnical updates to their engineering the most signi\ufb01cant nical update has been the introduction of entrepreneurship courses and experiences for a lot of attention has recently been given to equipping students with entrepreneurial students learn about entrepreneurship in their courses as well as through university university mathematics curriculum the mathematics curriculum changed very little in the current it remains a largely analytic where lutions are mainly obtained the current mathematics curriculum emphasizes theory over practical for when \ufb01nding the extreme values of a approach is preferred over the gradient there are two key reasons for why analytical approaches are favored over numerical analytical solutions are reliable and an analytical solution is guaranteed to be mathematics courses are usually taught by pure mathematicians who have an inherent preference for analytical pure mathematics which is based on theorem proving is not amenable to numerical despite the popularity of analytical approaches to problem solving in there has been a growing push to grate computer algebra systems as part of the learning computer algebra systems such as matlab and mathematica are now routinely used in many mathematics the study by cretchley et found that engineering students were positive about the use of technology as a learning tool in mathematics the increased use of technology in class helped improve student focus and interest in student evaluations also indicated that they had a greater level of enjoyment towards the lectures due to the use of it is noteworthy that students chose not to rely too heavily on technology during the examinations despite the freedom to do the students found it extremely important to be competent with analytical mathematical skills as opposed to purely putational some revealed that they learn the subjects equally well without the help of scienti\ufb01c although the perception towards the use of computer is in general highly almost all students responded positively to matlab as an effective tool for computation and many used matlab for for they utilized it to check their handwritten mathematical steps in assignments and practice and others used it for exploration beyond the standard syllabus and the in\ufb02uence of computer technology on demic performance and learning experience has been tigated by several abdul majid et used matlab as an aid to teach calculus to engineering the software package was used for various course learning outcomes such as graphical display of mathematical identifying and predicting structural patterns in evaluating a series of complex inde\ufb01nite and cal approximations in applied the study showed a positive impact on academic performance in the \ufb01nal the study concluded that the integration of scienti\ufb01c packages into engineering mathematics courses could be effective under certain other studies also found a positive impact from the use of scienti\ufb01c software packages on motivation in learning in a separate study by brake the authors investigated the use of matlab in engineering mathematics courses to increase student con\ufb01dence level and mathematical matlab was used to solve concrete engineering problems which require a deep understanding of underlying mathematical the study found generally positive student response to the use of software in their mathematics the results of the study must be considered carefully given the small sample size of the although the majority of the studies were based on the use of several other studies considered alternative mathematics software the study by kilicman et focused on the use of maple to help students understand both the theoretical and computational aspects of linear algebra for engineering in it was shown that the use of maple facilitates the understanding of computational pects of eigenvalues and it allows students more time to focus on the theoretical aspects and the underlying mathematical in a recent study by mezhennaya and pugachev the authors compared engineering perceptions regarding several mathematical mathematica and the study found that all the scienti\ufb01c packages considered can be used in under the condition that the policies for software usage are carefully the study found that many students lack experience on how to use the the students particularly struggled with matlab and mathematica \ufb01nding them non user the study concluded that additional classes are required to prepare students to use software in their numerical computing in mathematics curriculum mathematics lies at the foundation of science and the importance of mathematics courses in engineering education cannot be these courses equip dents with the fundamental skills and knowledge to study the more specialized engineering student success in engineering studies depends directly on the mathematics and sciences given the signi\ufb01cance of the mathematics courses in the engineering it is paramount to ensure their currency with respect to the industry the technological advances over the last decade have created demand for more computationally pro\ufb01cient to meet this numerical computing must become a core part of engineering mathematics courses offer a natural and convenient avenue for introducing numerical computing to engineering there are two main tors that make mathematics courses particularly amenable to numerical in many cases mathematical problems have numerical for \ufb01nding the root of a polynomial or the minimum value of a function can be done it is both logical and appropriate to apply numerical computing to mathematical mathematics courses are usually taken at the beginning of the study students become acquainted with numerical computing at an early the computing and programming skills acquired in this manner will have a positive effect in the more downstream engineering the key idea for the proposed curriculum update is the addition of computing tutorials to mathematics in we propose adding weekly computing tutorials related to the main lecture for in the week in which students cover \ufb01nding the extreme values of a there will be a computing tutorial where students learn and implement the gradient descent the suggested length of each tutorial is it is enough time to implement most of the numerical algorithms at the undergraduate at the same extra hour per week will not overburden the the exact details of numerical computing content is left for individual universities and depending on the syllabus and course learning the numerical puting labs will be different for each university and the general ideas will be broadly similar across different to illustrate the proposed numerical puting we will focus on the three main concept in and limits limit is a fundamental concept in students are usually taught to calculate limits using analytical although analytical approaches work there is no single universal rule for calculating on the other in most limits can be calculated numerically using essentially the same to suppose we want to calculate then we can loop for k to n and calculate as k approaches so in most approach the limit we can deduce the limit by observing the values of or determine that the limit does not exist if there is no pattern of the value of n can be chosen manually or using a stopping for the algorithm may continue to iterate until the difference between consecutive values of is below a certain the value of the limit can also be deduced automatically based on the values of using various another common limit problem is in this we can loop for k to n and calculate as k approaches so in most approach the limit then the limit can be determined based on the values of various extensions and tomizations of this basic approach can be for to avoid issues with periodic functions where \u01ebk are randomly can be other values than can also be used as long as the sequence approaches a degree of automization can be introduced using different derivative derivative is arguably the most important concept in there exist several rules such as the power the product the chain and others to \ufb01nd the derivative of a function by manual differentiation may be cumbersome when dealing with complex on the other calculating the derivative at a point numerically is relatively to suppose that we want to calculate f recall that f lim h to calculate f numerically we use the same approach as with the in we can loop for k to n and calculate then the and by extension the can be deduced based on the calculated the accuracy of the approximation depends in large part on the value of one of the most important applications of the derivative is \ufb01nding the extreme values of a this is done by \ufb01rst \ufb01nding the critical points of the function and then applying the second derivative \ufb01nding the critical points is not always so numerical approaches can be used in such the most popular numerical approach for \ufb01nding the extreme values is based on the gradient descent in gradient the optimal value of x is iteratively updated based on the in for k to the updated optimal value of x is given by xk where is the gradient and \u03b1 is the step in the case of a the gradient equals simply to the derivative f the step size \u03b1 can be either \ufb01xed or while a large value of \u03b1 accelerates the convergence at the it may hurt the convergence in the region near the optimal there exist several extensions of the basic gradient descent one such extension is gradient descent with mentum which uses the second derivative to anticipate the location of the next optimal point and thus accelerates the integrals integration is an important concept in engineering although there exist a number of rules for \ufb01nding the it is signi\ufb01cantly more challenging than in many the inde\ufb01nite integral does not even numerical approaches are particularly useful for to illustrate the application of numerical pose that we want to calculate b a there exist several numerical methods for calculating the one simple method is based on the riemann the interval is divided into n equal subintervals with endpoints let \u03b4 be the length of each then the right riemann sum is de\ufb01ned as \u03b4 the riemann sum provides an approximation of the b a dx lim \u03b4 n the riemann sums can be quickly calculated on a computer providing a yet effective approach to calculating integrals other popular integral approximation methods include the trapezoid rule and the additional considerations the above discussion about numerical methods for culating and integrals is easily extended to multivariate for to \ufb01nd the partial derivative we can loop for k to n and calculate many problems related to sequences and series can similarly be solved using numerical in the convergence of a series can be deduced from its partial by calculating the partial sums on the computer and observing the we can intuit the nature of the vectorization is an important aspect of numerical since the modern computer chips are optimized for matrix it is more ef\ufb01cient to employ vector in some algorithms based on can be converted into vector operations resulting in higher ef\ufb01ciency and for the riemann sum can be calculated with a single vector \u03b4 n \u03b4s where x is the vector of is a vectorized function and s is the vector tion which returns the sum of all the limit calculations can be vectorized and made more vectorization is also useful in where operations can be performed on a vector of the choice of the programming language for numerical computing requires careful there are several suitable candidates for this purpose including and based on our experience with different programming we recommend the use of python is currently the most popular programming language on the it has a simple and intuitive syntax making it easy to learn and python has libraries to \ufb01t any purpose including an extensive collection of libraries related to numerical the basic python libraries related to computing are and more advanced packages such as are also available for optimization since python is a universal programming it can be used for almost any students who learn python in their mathematics courses can employ it in their other in numerical computing implemented in python can be connected to other conclusion although the classical approach to teaching mathematics is still relevant for certain student it is outdated for engineering modern engineering is increasingly liant on computing universities must equip the student with appropriate computing in mathematics courses must be revised to include numerical computing given the ef\ufb01ciency of ical computing provides a convenient approach to problem solving in engineering it can be integrated into the existing curriculum with little hassle and in this we proposed a framework for integrating numerical computing into the existing mathematics we demonstrated how numerical approaches can be used some of the most common problems encountered in the proposed framework can be customized by individual universities to \ufb01t their special",
