    "abstract": "The Stochastic Subset Optimization (SSO) algorithm was proposed for optimal reliability problems that minimizes the probability of system failure over the admissible space for the design parameters. It is based on the simulation of samples of the design parameters from an auxiliary Probability Density Function (PDF) and exploiting the information contained in these samples to identify subregions for the optimal design parameters within the original design space. This paper presents an improved version of SSO, named iSSO to overcome the shortcomings in the SSO. In the improved version, the Voronoi tessellation is implemented to partition the design space into non-overlapping subregions using the pool of samples distributed according to the auxiliary PDF. A double-sort approach is then used to identify the subregions for the optimal design. The iSSO is presented as a generalized design optimization approach primarily tailored for the stochastic structural systems but also adaptable to deterministic systems. Several optimization problems are considered to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iSSO.",
    "content": "introduction structural optimization may be defined as the rational establishment of an economical structural design with the available resources while satisfying specific performance in general the economy may be characterized by minimum minimum maximum or even minimum probability of structural optimization can be categorized into deterministic and stochastic optimization the classical statement of unconstraint deterministic optimization is mathematically expressed minimize \u03c6\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6rn\u03c6 is a set of deterministic adjustable parameters that define the structural referred to herein as design rn\u03c6r is the objective function to be and \u03c6 denotes the bounded admissible design the deterministic constraints can be considered by the appropriate definition of the admissible design space \u03c6 for deterministic design parameters as mentioned in in the deterministic structural optimization the uncertainties in parameters are and fixed values are assumed for all the there are numerous optimizations approaches available in the but its worth noting that no optimization approach is ideal for all sorts of problems the choice of optimization method is often determined by the specific characteristics of the such as its and the nature of the objective as a there is always a scope for new approaches to be developed or the adaptation of existing methods to better suit specific problem a detailed discussion of deterministic optimization approaches can be found in the literature in any practical several such as structural geometric operation are either not known at the design stage or are subjected to random fluctuations that give rise to performance variability and affect the performance of a system these parameters are characterized as uncertain deterministic structural optimization discards the impact of uncertainty and can result in improper it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in the parameters during optimization by using the rational methods of probabilistic structural analysis such structural optimization that accounts for uncertainties is called stochastic optimization although stochastic optimization refers to any method that employs randomness within some in this we will only consider settings where corresponding contents lists available at sciencedirect advances in engineering software journal received june received in revised form october accepted november advances in engineering software the objective function is stochastic optimization or optimal design under uncertainty has been widely applied in many practical engineering including civil engineering structures composite structures and vehicles consider an engineering system that involves deterministic design parameters and uncertain variables \u03b8 following a joint pdf where \u03b8 denotes the parameter space of the tain the classical statement of stochastic optimization is mathematically expressed minimize is the structural performance and denotes expectation with respect to the pdf for note that the objective function in the optimization problem in is the expectation which is a deterministic worth mentioning that stochastic optimization may also involve other stochastic measures such as variance or quantile these stochastic measures can rarely be evaluated several methods have been proposed for solving stochastic optimization these ized methods for sample average stochastic stochastic subset and proaches based on the use of taylor series expansion response and metamodels specific to structural there are two broad categories of problems involving design optimization under uncertainty design optimization and robust design optimization the objective of rbdo is to find an optimal solution that minimizes some objective function under observance of probabilistic constraints instead of conventional deterministic constraints on the other rdo aims to find an optimal solution that is sitive less to input it improves the design quality by minimizing performance variation without eliminating certainty taflanidis and beck introduced a novel algorithm for optimal reliability the sso involves formulating an augmented problem where the design parameters are artificially considered uncertain and defining an auxiliary pdf that includes the structural performance function and the pdf of the uncertain sso involves generating a pool of samples distributed according to this auxiliary pdf and identifying a subregion in the original design on improves the value of the objective by repeating this procedure several it is possible to determine at each step a smaller subregion in the design which in turn proves the value of the objective this subregion will be sufficiently small to directly identify the optimal solution or provide sufficient information to launch another optimization such as the sample average approximation or stochastic the implementation of the sso method closely resembles the subset simulation algorithm for reliability since sso is based on it can deal with linear or nonlinear problems at least an unbounded number of design the numerical effort for solving a given optimization problem is dent of the number of uncertain and it grows linearly with the number of design since the introduction of several extensions of sso have been an extension of sso termed which adopts kernel density estimation to approximate the objective is presented in in efficient integration of the moving least squares approximation within sso is introduced to reduce the tational effort in in an augmented formulation is presented for the rdo of structures using sso or its variants have also been applied to solve structural optimization sso has been used for reliability optimization and sensitivity analysis in system design in a framework for rdo of tuned mass dampers by sso is cussed in even though sso has proved to be efficient for meeting various challenging optimization it has two the effectiveness of sso is dependent on the correct selection of the geometrical shape of the admissible it is pertinent to mention that choosing a geometrical shape that effectively investigates the sensitivity of the objective function to each design variable is the such as and are suggested in the literature for the admissible as shown later via the illustrative these shapes fail to include the optimal solution in cases with complex design spaces or problems with multiple optimal and identifying the optimal subset that tains the smallest volume density involves a optimization problem which is quite in this an improved version of sso is developed to overcome the shortcomings of the original this new version of the as mentioned is named isso voronoi tion is implemented to partition the design space into subregions set of voronoi using the pool of samples uted according to the auxiliary the admissible set set of all admissible is then defined as a set containing all subsets of the set of voronoi this approach is able to capture the regions with lower objective function values even if they are disjointed or when the design space is the details of the voronoi tessellation are presented in appendix a algorithm is then implemented to identify the optimal subset containing the smallest volume in the next the original sso is section presents the general theoretical and computational framework for the isso section considers several optimization problems to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed isso original stochastic subset optimization in say at the i the design space is represented by a subset where following the augmented formulation concept initially discussed in for the design parameters are artificially considered uncertain variables with a prescribed pdf over the design space for is where is the volume of in this setting of the augmented stochastic design the auxiliary pdf is defined \u03c0 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 note that if it must be suitably transformed to ensure that one way to do this is to define since that the two expected values differ only by a and the optimization of the expected value of is in terms of the optimal design to optimization for the expected value for in the above the denominator is a normalizing constant given \u03c6 \u03b8 \u03b8 although this expected value is not explicitly it can be determined using any stochastic simulation the objective function in this context of the auxiliary pdf is expressed \u03c0 \u03c6 p \u03c6 the marginal is given \u03c0 \u03c6 in since is a normalizing minimization of khalid and bansal advances in engineering software is equivalent to minimization of which is equal j \u03c6 \u03c0 \u03c6 p \u03c6 the estimation of the marginal in is necessary to mize analytical approximations of based on kernel density approaches or the maximum entropy method might be arduous in case of complex such as when design parameters n\u03c6 are or the sensitivity for some design parameters is complex in the sso such approximation of is in samples distributed as are and the information in these samples is exploited to identify a smaller subset of the design space with a high likelihood of containing the optimal design samples distributed as are obtained using any appropriate stochastic sampling such as markov chain monte carlo sampling the \u03c6 component of these samples then responds to samples from the marginal distribution the sensitivity of objective function to \u03c6 is determined by evaluating the average value equivalently volume of over any subset i in which is denoted by and defined vi i j d\u03c6 vi i \u03c0 p d\u03c6 vi i \u03c0 d\u03c6 vi is the volume of subset based on the samples distributed according to belonging to an estimate of is provided is the number of samples distributed as belonging to and ni denotes the number of samples from belonging to the i say ni a smaller value of \u03c1 sults in a faster decrease in the size of the identified subsets but with poorer the use of \u03c1 equal to is suggested in the literature a deterministic based on the estimate of is next performed to identify the subset i \u03c1 where \u03c1 is a set of admissible subsets in that contains the smallest volume density that argmin arg min \u03c1 ni vi \u03c1 \u03c1 ni the effectiveness of sso is dependent on the correct selection of the geometrical shape and size of the admissible choosing a geometrical shape that effectively investigates the sensitivity of the objective function to each design variable is the optimization in determines the subset with the smallest average value of equivalently within the admissible set \u03c1 is a subset of the design space with a high likelihood of containing the optimal design the above steps are repeated until the stopping criterion is this sso adaptively converges to a relatively small subregion within the original design the mentation of sso is demonstrated in the reader may refer to the original publication for a detailed explanation of sso expresses the average relative sensitivity of to a low value of indicates that is more sensitive to and vice a high value of close to corresponds to a sample density in design space that approximates a uniform distribution and suggests that the identified subset has a low likelihood of containing the sso is stopped when exceeds a threshold a threshold value of has been found to give satisfactory results proposed approach in the proposed the voronoi tessellation is implemented to partition the design space into subregions set of voronoi using the pool of samples distributed according to this auxiliary voronoi tessellation involves partitioning a space into convex called voronoi such that each cell contains exactly one called a every sample in a given polygon is closer to its generating sample compared to any in the proposed the admissible set set of all admissible is defined as a set containing all subsets of the set of voronoi an alternative approach to identify the optimal subset without performing any deterministic optimization is also the general theoretical and computational framework for the isso algorithm is presented in the following and the illustration of the original sso khalid and bansal advances in engineering software algorithm is demonstrated in partitioning of design space in the proposed at the i say is the number of samples distributed as belonging to the design space let nv \u03b3 be the number of unique if sampling techniques such as accept importance are then \u03b3 and each sample in the design space will be if mcmc sampling techniques are the resulting samples will be that is \u03b3 and we will have repeated assume that the design space is divided into k k voronoi cells using nv unique and say the voronoi cell k contains k repeated an estimate of is provided \u03c0 k k \u03c6 k k is the volume of the kth voronoi d\u03c6 similar to the original the sensitivity of the objective function j to \u03c6 is determined by evaluating the average value of over any subspace i of the design space subset i is any subset of nvvoronoi cells cells may be since the design space is partitioned into nv subspaces or voronoi the number of admissible subsets is given by based on the estimate provided in an estimate of is provided vi i \u03c0 d\u03c6 vi i vi ni vi is the volume of the subset i and ni is the number of samples belonging to let i where s is the number of onoi cells defining the subset note that the parentheses are used in the subscript to differentiate between the voronoi cell number defined in the previous section from the voronoi cell index describing the subset an estimate of is then provided identification of an optimal subset a deterministic optimization needs to be performed to identify a subset i that contains the smallest volume density in the case of unique since the solution to the minimization problem in is a set of voronoi cells with the largest for the case with repeated the optimization can be performed using methods appropriate for optimization such as bundle gradient sampling in this we propose an alternative approach to identify the optimal subset without performing any deterministic a algorithm is which involves sorting the voronoi cells in ascending order of the sample counts and then in groups of cells with the same sample count in descending order of cell the top cells containing are selected as an approximate optimal solution from the sorted one may argue that the optimal subset can be obtained by first sorting the voronoi cells in ascending order of the cell defined as k k and then by selecting the top cells containing samples from the sorted this argument is erroneous because the objective is to minimize and not the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in section with the help of simulation of conditional samples at the i samples distributed as are available from the previous using these samples as additional are the proposed method to simulate additional samples involves two randomly selecting a voronoi cell within the subset based on the estimate and applying the algorithm within the selected voronoi a voronoi cell is selected according to the following weights in the first k k k k k k illustration of the proposed isso khalid and bansal advances in engineering software to simulate a new sample within a selected voronoi the sample that generated the selected voronoi cell or the last simulated sample in the selected voronoi cell is used as the seed and the hastings algorithm is a candidate sample is simulated using the proposal and is accepted with the probability is given in the present the proposed pdf is equal to the uniform pdf for design parameters and the initial pdf for uncertain q on simplifying is given stopping criteria a new stopping criterion is proposed in this the convergence of the expected value of the performance measure with respect to the pdf for \u03c6 and \u03b8 in consecutive iterations is used as the stopping mathematically the proposed stopping criterion is represented \u03b5 \u03b5 is a tolerance other stopping as indicated in can also be implementation issues an important issue for the effective implementation of the isso is the creation of the voronoi cells at the current iteration bounded within the voronoi cell created at the previous although it is possible to create such bounded voronoi due to the geometrical it is usually unfeasible for the higher dimensional problems an alternative approach is proposed in the present study for creating the voronoi cells at any iteration of the the proposed approach volves creating voronoi cells using the samples generated at the current and all previous iterations and then by considering voronoi cells responding to the samples from the current this is shown in where shows the n samples at the first iteration and the corresponding voronoi shows the \u03c1n selected voronoi cells leading to the smallest volume density and the additional samples being generated using these \u03c1n samples as shows that the voronoi cells are generated using all n samples that are generated in the two the voronoi cells corresponding to the n samples for consideration at the second iteration are also highlighted in shows a version of where it can be observed that the area covered by the n voronoi cells considered in the second iteration is not the same as the area covered by the \u03c1n voronoi cells selected in the first on the the area covered by the voronoi cells in the second iteration is more than the area covered by the voronoi cells corresponding to the seed samples from the first this is because a new sample within the voronoi cell between an existing sample and the existing voronoi cell edge results in the relocation of the voronoi cell edge in a implementation of voronoi tessellation in khalid and bansal advances in engineering software direction away from the new the increase at each iteration troduces a bias in the estimate of in this does not affect the performance of the proposed approach as the objective is not to simulate the samples distributed as but to identify the subsets for an optimal in the increase is not as seen later in the illustrative examples in section special deterministic optimization in the isso a deterministic optimization problems can also be handled with the vector of uncertain variables \u03b8 set equal to a null vector since the determination of the subset at each isso iteration is solely dependent on the samples distributed as no modification to the isso algorithm is required to solve a deterministic optimization and the entire formulation remains illustrative examples in this typical optimization problems are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed deterministic optimization problems are these lems include several local and global stochastic zation problems are the second example presents an rdo problem of the in this the variance minimization of the protected displacement attached to the is in the third the mean minimization of bars truss problems is explored to demonstrate the applicability of the posed approach to a stochastic design the fourth example investigates the tion of a base isolation system for a in this after implementing the optimal design solution is identified as let j be a set of identically distributed realizations of and let be the structural mance function realization for the expected structural performance function is approximated by the average of the realizations n n h \u03b8j is evaluated for all unique \u03c6 samples obtained at the last iteration of the and the \u03c6 sample resulting in the smallest value of is taken as the optimal as the hand side of is any deterministic optimization method can also be used to solve the optimization problem with the approximate in the following both isso and sso are implemented with n \u03c1 and the stopping criteria as stated in a value of \u03b5 is results for the griewank khalid and bansal advances in engineering software multimodal deterministic optimization problems in this three benchmark deterministic optimization problems are results are also compared with the the test functions griewank d i d cos i \u03c0 holder table \u03c0 the results for the griewank function are presented in shows that the function has multiple closely spaced local minima with a single global shows the sso optimization using and as shapes of admissible it is seen that these shapes fail to capture the region containing the optimal design due to the presence of multiple local the isso is where the voronoi cells selected at the first and last iteration are shown in it is observed that at the first the selected voronoi cells effectively capture both the local and global minima and in the subsequent the selected cells are more concentrated near the global the region selected at the last iteration captures the optimal global the function has a relatively complex design space compared to the griewank shows multiple local and global minimization by using sso is demonstrated in it is found that both the and are trapped around any one of the global at the same the isso is able to capture the regions that include all of the global as results for the khalid and bansal advances in engineering software seen in the holder table function has multiple local and global the global minima are placed at the boundary of the design as shown in once it is seen that both the and are trapped around any of one of the global and on the other the isso is able to capture the regions that include all of the global as seen in the results from the three examples demonstrate that the proposed isso is able to capture the regions containing the optimal solution the statistics of the results of independent both for sso and isso are presented in table it also includes the results obtained by using such as the genetic particle swarm and the gradient based optimization approach the proposed isso outperforms all other approaches as more successes in determining the optimal solution are observed in all three optimization it is also seen that both sso and isso result in a similar value of volume reduction for the same stopping with the number of iterations required to achieve this volume reduction are relatively the proposed approach outperformed the as indicated by the number of these examples demonstrate that the main advantage of implementing voronoi tessellation is an effective ration of the design the performance of the proposed sort for selecting the optimal subset is studied by using the three shows the value of for the dent simulation which is estimated by implementing the proposed double sort algorithm and by using the genetic it can be noted that for each the values obtained using the proposed double sort algorithm and genetic algorithm are well thereby confirming the adequacy of the proposed double sort at any iteration of new samples are simulated using the seed in the proposed the volume of the voronoi cells corresponding to the seed and new samples is greater than the volume of the voronoi cells corresponding only to the seed shows this change in volume due to the creation of voronoi cells at any generation of isso using the procedure mentioned in section the increase is observed to be small which further reduces with an crease in the iteration it is also observed that the increase in volume decreases with an increase in sample size at each iteration and increases with an increase in the dimension of the robust design

to identify the subregions for the optimal design at each isso several mathematical and engineering design including bars truss and are included in this study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed the results show that the proposed isso effectively identifies the reduced design space for complex design problems with multiple global and local this is attributable to the voronoi which eliminates the ment of the presumed admissible design space form to resemble the contour of the original voronoi tessellation enabled better design space allowing multiple global minima scattered throughout the design pace to be effectively due to the cretization of the design space via voronoi computation demand is significantly reduced as the number of function evaluations for all examples is lower the original the novel idea of the double sort approach achieves the requisite precision in identifying the subregions for optimal solutions and makes isso implementation simple and the applicability of the approach is dependent on the creation of the voronoi at present the methods available in the literation for creating the voronoi tessellation are computationally demanding when considering problems of very high future work will focus on developing a method for creating the voronoi tessellation in higher particularly those greater than credit authorship contribution statement mohd aman formal writing original sahil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this data availability no data was used for the research described in the voronoi tessellation voronoi tessellation is a mathematical concept named after the russian mathematician georgy it is also known as the voronoi diagram or dirichlet a voronoi tessellation of a set of points p in a plane is a partition of the plane into a set of convex with each polygon including precisely one point of p and each point in a polygon being closer to its associated point in p than to any other point in each polygon is referred to as a voronoi cell or a dirichlet the boundary of each cell is constituted of points that are equidistant to two or more points in shows the voronoi diagram in a design voronoi diagram in there are several efficient algorithms for creating voronoi one such basic algorithm is to start with a set of points and then compute the voronoi cells by dividing the space into regions based on the distance to the nearest the algorithm which generates a delaunay triangulation in any number of can be applied while creating a voronoi the delaunay triangulation is a triangulation of the point in which no point falls within the circumcircle of any the polygon generated by the intersection of the defined by the edges of the delaunay triangles enclosing the point is therefore obtained as the voronoi cell of a it can be summarized that voronoi tessellation is a powerful mathematical concept that aids in dividing space into regions based on the distance to a set of voronoi tessellation finds widespread applications in areas such as image processing spatial topology analysis and microstructure study the matlab command from the computing has been used in this study to create the voronoi",
