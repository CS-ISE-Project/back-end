        "abstract": "Identifying the frames of news is important to understand the articles vision, intention, message to be conveyed, and which aspects of the news are emphasized. Framing is a widely studied concept in journalism, and has emerged as a new topic in computing, with the potential to automate processes and facilitate the work of journalism professionals. In this paper, we study this issue with articles related to the Covid19 antivaccine movement. First, to understand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocol for human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No Vax movement articles of European newspapers from 5 countries. Headlines are key units in the written press, and worth of analysis as many people only read headlines (or use them to guide their decision for further reading.) Second, considering advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with large language models, we investigated two approaches for frame inference of news headlines: first with a GPT3.5 finetuning approach, and second with GPT 3.5 promptengineering. Our work contributes to the study and analysis of the performance that these models have to facilitate journalistic tasks like classification of frames, while understanding whether the models are able to replicate human perception in the identification of these frames."

    "content": "introduction in recent there has been a proliferation in the use of concepts such as data computational and computer assisted reporting which all share the vision of bridging journalism and the progress made in nlp has been gradually integrated into the journalistic field more machine learning models based on transformers have been integrated in the media sector in different tasks such as the creation of headlines with generative languages models summarization of news articles false news detection and topic modeling and sentiment analysis the development of large language models such as bloom or chatgpt show a clear trend towards humanmachine interaction becoming easier and more opening up a wide range of research at the same the use of these models is also associated with a lack of transparency regarding how these models but efforts are being made to bring some transparency to these and to analyze use cases where they can be useful and where they cannot based on the premises that these models open up a wide range of research directions and that at the same time needless to they are not the solution to all we are interested in identifying use cases and tasks where they can be potentially while acknowledging and systematically documenting their limitations more the aim of this work is to analyze the performance of for a specific use namely the analysis of frames in from an empirical point of with the objective of shedding light on a potential use of generative models in journalistic frame analysis is a concept from which consists of studying the way in which news stories are presented on an and what aspects are is a merely informative vision given in an or is it intended to leave a moral is a news article being presented from an economic point of or from a more emotional the examples above correspond to different frames with which an article can be the concept of news framing has been studied in computing as a step beyond topic modeling and sentiment and for this in recent pretrained language models have been used for finetuning the classification process of these frames but the emergence of generative models opens the possibility of doing promptengineering of these classification instead of the finetuning approach investigated so our work aims to address this research gap by posing the following research what are the main frames in the news headlines about the antivaccine as reported in newspapers across european icmr june greece david alonso del barrio and daniel can prompt engineering be used for classification of lines according to by addressing the above research our work makes the following contribution we implemented a process to do human notation of the main frame of headlines of articles about the as reported in newspapers from european countries switzerland and united at the headline we found that the predominant frame was human where this frame corresponds to a sonification of an either through a statement by a or the explanation of a specific event that happened to a we found a large number of headlines annotated as containing no as they simply present information without entering into we also found that for all the countries the distribution of frame types was very man interest and no frame are the two predominant the generated annotations allowed to subsequently study the formance of a large language contribution we studied the performance of on the task of frame classification of in addition to using the approach from previous we propose an alternative approach for frame classification that requires no labeled data for namely using the results show that with produces accuracy higher than other smaller and that the engineering approach results in lower performance our analysis also shows that the subjectivity of the human labeling task has an effect on the obtained the paper is organized as in section we discuss related in section we describe the news in section we describe the methodology for both human labeling and machine classification of news we present and discuss results for and in sections and we provide conclusions in section related work framing has been a concept widely studied in with a definition that is rooted in the study of this domain frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating in such a way as to promote a ticular problem causal moral treatment recommendation for the item for frame there are two main the tive approach where one can extract the frames after reading the and the deductive approach where a predefined list of frames exists and the goal is to interpret if any of them pears in the in the deductive there are generic frames and and the way to detect them typically involves reading and identifying one frame at a or through answers to questions that represent the semetko et used types of generic frames of human and economic based on previous and they defined a list of questions to detect frames in for the questions about morality are the the story contain any moral does the story make reference to and other religious does the story offer specific social prescriptions about how to and so on for each of the frame this categorization of frames has been used in various topics such as climate change vaccine hesitance or immigration we now compare the two approaches on a common such as ebrahim et followed an inductive approach in which the frames were not predefined but emerged from the text deadly stay what the cost of using headlines as the unit of in the deductive approach has studied very different et followed the method of but in addition to the generic frames presented they also used blame frame and fear adiprasetio et and rodelo used the generic frames with while et used the frames and read the headline and subheadline to decide the main table summarizes some of the the existing this previous work showed how frame labels can be and also that frame analysis has been done at both headline and article these two approaches and that originated in journalism have since been replicated in the computing we decided to follow the deductive approach because a fined list of frames allows to compare among previous and also because they represent a fixed list of labels for machine classification the tive approach tends to be more specific to a and from the computing past work has tried to justify topic modeling as a technique to extract frames from et proposed topic modeling as a frame traction they argued that topics can be interpreted as frames if three requirements are frames are operationalized as connections between data is and topics are adequately validated as for which they suggested a practical this approach was based on the choice of a specific topic climate and the use of latent dirichlet allocation as a technique to extract a number of in a second a qualitative study of the top words of each subtopic was and the different subtopics were nated or reducing the number and establishing a tentative in a third the top articles belonging to that were and if the description of the topic fitted at least of the that the frames found in this article green emission negotiations and environmental cost of carbon chinese economics of energy climate vironmental burden state leaders and citizen from definition of frame it seems that the tive approach is more refined than the inductive approach seems to resemble the detection of for with regard to climate there are stories on how people have been affected by climate change from an emotional point of thus personalizing the in this we could categorize the corresponding frame as human as the writer of the article is selecting aspects of a perceived reality and make them framing the from human perception to large language model inferences icmr june greece more the language subtleties with which news articles are presented cannot be captured with basic topic isoaho et held the position that while the benefits of scale and scope in topic modeling were there were also a number of namely that topic outputs do not correspond to the methodological definition of and thus topic modeling remained an incomplete method for frame topic in the practice of journalistic is a useful technique to deal with the large datasets that are yet is often not enough to do more thorough analyses in our we clearly notice that frame analysis is not topic for two documents could be about the same say but one article could emphasize the number of deaths after while the other emphasized the role of the vaccine as a solution to the we also consider that the larger the number of possible frame the more likely it is to end up doing topic modeling instead of frame using a deductive dallas et created a dataset with articles about polemic topics such as same sex or and they defined types of capacity and fairness and constitutionality and policy prescription and crime and security and health and quality of cultural external regulation and in this they authors did not use a list of for each annotators were asked to identify any of the framing dimensions present in the article and to label text blurbs that cued them on the definitions of each of the frame and decide the main frame of each in our we followed the idea of detecting the main frame by reading the text instead of answering but instead of using the frames proposed in we used the generic frames proposed in a final decision in our work was the type of text to whether headlines or whole for this the chosen classification method was also going to be for khanehzar et used traditional approaches such as svms as and demonstrated the improvement in frame tion with the use of languages models such as roberta and following a setting as input text a maximum of tokens the maximum number of input tokens in these models is liu et classified news headlines about the gun problem in the united arguing for the choice of headlines as a unit of analysis based on previous journalism literature that advocated for the importance and influence of headlines on readers and the subsequent perception of from a computational using headlines is also an since you avoid the token limitation in we decided to work with headlines about a controversial namely the continuing with the question of the methods used for much work has been developed in prompt especially since the release of liu et presented a good overview of the work done on this new nlp not only explaining the concept of prompt but also the ent strategies that can be followed both in the design of table summary of deductive approaches for frame analysis ref frames goal technique

knowledge probing information extraction nlp reasoning tion answering text generation learning and text classification the latter being the use case in our puri et presented a very interesting idea that we apply to our classification this consists of viding the language model with natural language descriptions of classification tasks as and training it to generate the correct answer in natural language via a language modeling it is a learning in which no examples are used to explain the task to the radford et demonstrated that language models can learn tasks without any explicit we have followed this approach to find an alternative way to do frame as mentioned the emergence of giant models like and chatgpt are a very active research to the best of our on one hand our work extends the computational analysis of news related to the which illustrates the influence of the press on the ways societies think about relevant issues and on the other hand it adds to the literature of regarding the design of prompts for classification tasks european news dataset we used part of the european news dataset collected in our recent work this dataset contains articles on vaccination from newspapers from different icmr june greece david alonso del barrio and daniel switzerland and the articles cover a time period of from january to october all content was translated into english to be able to work in a common the dataset was used for various such as name entity sentiment and subtopic to stand how vaccination was reported in europe through the print media digital the subtopic modeling analysis revealed a subsample of articles on the which is the one we have used in this we took the headlines of the articles associated with the selecting all articles containing any of the keywords in table in the headline or in the main this corresponds to a total of table keywords used to identify articles keywords no vax topic in table we show the number of headlines per country and france is the country with the most articles in the with followed by italy with note that there are newspapers from while only from corriere della sera is the newspaper that dealt most frequently with the subject while the telegraph is the second one the total number of articles normalized by the number of newspapers per country is also shown in the last column of the using these normalized the ranking is and table number of headlines by newspaper and country country newspaper headlines total france la croix le monde les echos liberation lyon capitale ouest france italy corriere della sera il sole ore spain minutos abc el diario el mundo el espa\u00f1ol la vanguardia switzerland heures la libert\u00e9 le temps united kingdom the irish news the telegraph methodology human labeling of news frames to carry out the labeling of the frames in our corpus of we first designed a which contained the definitions of each of the frame types and a couple of examples of each as well as a definition of the corpus subject matter and definitions of the concept of frame so that the annotators could understand the task to be the codebook follows the proposed by with generic frames of human and economic plus one additional two researchers were engaged to annotate a sample of the collected newspaper articles following a training in the first annotators had to read the codebook and get familiar with the in the second they were asked to identify the main frame in the same subset of at the end of the second the intercoder reliability was between the we analyzed those cases where there were and observed that in some there was not a unique main because both annotators had valid arguments to select one of the in other the discrepancies were due to slight misunderstanding of the in the third the annotators coded again and the icr increased to was we realized that the possibility of having two frames they discussed the cases in which they had and if the other arguments were considered it could be said that there were two after this training annotators were ready to annotate the dataset we divided the dataset into two equal and each person annotated and models with the annotated we investigated two nlp the first one involves a the second one is prompt language models have been figure prompt trained with large text strings based on two unsupervised next sentence prediction and masked language figure summarizes these in the first a model with a fixed architecture is trained as a language model predicting the likelihood of the observed textual this can be done due to the availability of raw text data needed to train this learning process can produce general purpose features of the modeled the learning process produces features of the language being the above lm is then adapted to different downstream by introducing additional parameters and adjusting them using objective in this the focus was primarily on goal designing the training targets used in both the and the stages framing the from human perception to large language model inferences icmr june greece we present an example to illustrate the imagine that the task is sentiment and we have a dataset with sentences and their associated and a which is a saved neural network trained with a much larger for that model to address the target we unfreeze a few of the top layers of the saved model base and jointly train both the classifier layers and the last layers of the base this allows to the feature representations in the base model to make them more relevant for the sentiment analysis in this instead of having to obtain a very large dataset with target labels to train a we can reuse the trained model and use a much smaller train we use a part of our dataset as examples for the model to learn the while the other part of the dataset is used to evaluate model previous works related to frame classification in the computing literature have used in our we have done the same as a but we aimed to go one step further and also produce results using of with model has been widely but with the emergence of generative models such as another way to approach classification tasks has the idea is to use the model directly and convert the task to be performed into a format as close as possible to the tasks for which it has been that if the model has been from next word prediction as in the case of classification can be done by defining a where the input to the model is an incomplete and the model must complete it with a word or several just as it has been this avoids having to use part of the already labeled dataset to teach the task to be performed to the and a previous labeling is not needed in this instead of adapting lms to stream tasks via objective downstream tasks are formulated to look more like those solved during the original lm training with the help of a textual for when nizing the emotion of a social media missed the bus we may continue with a prompt felt so and ask the lm to fill the blank with an or if we choose the prompt i missed the bus an lm may be able to fill in the blank with a french in this by selecting the appropriate we can influence the model behavior so that the lm itself can be used to predict the desired even without any additional training we use this emerging nlp approach to classify frames at headline we are not aware of previous uses of this strategy to classify frames as we propose the idea is the prompt neering consists of giving a prompt to the and understands that prompt as an incomplete to do prompt ing with our we needed to define an appropriate prompt that would produce the headline frames as we defined eral experiments with the playground of in order to find the best prompt for our in our initial we lowed existing approaches in prompt engineering to do sentiment where the individual answer was an and this adjective was matched with a in a similar we decided to build a thesaurus of adjectives that define each of the for the human interest frame could be the conflict frame could after the list of adjectives was we needed to define the prompt in order to as an one of the adjectives in our thesaurus to match them with the we used the playground using the headline as input and asking for the frame as but the strategy did not in our final instead of giving the headline as we gave the definitions of each type of frame plus the and we asked the model to choose between the different types of frames as in this the output of the model was directly one of the and we avoided the step of matching adjectives with an example is shown in figure figure for frame input and output for the configuration there are main temperature this parameter controls lowering it results in less random this parameter controls diversity via nucleus this parameter indicates the mum number of tokens to offer four main models with different levels of suitable for different davinci is the most capable and ada is the after testing with the playground and varying different to assess we set the temperature to since the higher the temperature the more random the the parameter was set to as it would likely get a set of the most likely words for the model to choose the maximum number of tokens was set to in this the model is asked to choose between one of the as a we used the one with the best performance at the time of experimental which was recognized as gpt human labeling of frames in news headlines in this we present and discuss the results of the analysis related to our first figure shows the distribution of frames per country at headline with human interest and being the predominant icmr june greece david alonso del barrio and daniel attribution of responsibility is the third one except in where the corresponding frame is morality and economic are the least represented in the dataset for every figure distribution of frames per country the monthly distribution of frames aggregated for all countries is shown in we can see two big the first one in january and the second one in august in all the cination process started at the end of december so it makes sense that the movement started to be more predominant in the news in january human interest is the most predominant manual inspection shows that this is because the headlines are about personal cases of people who are or attribution of responsibility is also manual inspection dicates that local politicians and health authorities had to make decisions about who could be vaccinated at the beginning of the the second peak at the end of summer coincided with the health pass called covid passport in some and we can observe a peak in the curve corresponding to the flict reflecting the demonstrations against the measure of mandatory health passes taken by country in figure we compare the sentiment per frame and per to understand if there were any major the sentiment analysis labels were obtained using from the hugging face package used in our previous work refer to our original analysis in for we normalized the results tween and to compare frames between we see that the sentiment is predominantly neutral examining in more figure monthly distribution of detail the negative and positive sentiment of each frame we observed a few attribution of negative sentiment represents of the while positive tone is only found in residual form in and the united negative sentiment represents of the predominantly with only negative tone in italy and uk the latter all headlines with this frame were considered human negative sentiment represents of the while positive tone is only found in residual form in and predominantly with negative tone in and the united no of negative figure sentiment of headline by frame and by country framing the from human perception to large language model inferences icmr june greece regarding the results of the annotation the fact that the distribution of the frame types is relatively similar between tries suggests that the movement issue was treated in a similar way in these the fact that human interest is the most dominant frame indicates that this issue was treated from a more human and emotional with headlines about personal celebrities giving their opinion about and politicians defending vaccine the reason for many headlines being classified as is partly due to how data was we chose articles that contained words related to either in the headline or in the this resulted in many headlines not containing anything specific related to while the content was actually included in the main text of the corresponding it is worth mentioning that prior to obtaining the we had expected that attribution of responsibility would be among the most prominent since governments took many measures such as mandatory health pass requirements to access certain we had also expected that the conflict frame would be since there were many demonstrations in in these frames categories were not reflected as frequently at the headline regarding the analysis at the temporal it is clear that certain events were captured by the such as the start of vaccination or the mandatory vaccination the sentiment analysis of the different frames shows that the predominant tone in all of them is neutral or with very similar trends between this association between ment analysis and frames has been discussed in previous literature for frame classification of headlines we present and discuss the results related to our second table shows the results of the classification task using three models were and two based we observe on performs better than the this is somehow expected as is a much larger in the case of the best performance for the frame classification task is which is with an improvement over previous models based on it should be noted that the performance differences are modest improvement between and table classification results for frame tion and cross validation accuracy average bert roberta on the other bert is while has an economic cost as the use of the model is not which monetarily limits the number of experiments that can be performed with as well as the different configurations one can explore to improve this is important because much of the improvement in performance requires empirical explorations of model parameters more the cost of an experiment for each of the folds has a cost of dollars the time of writing this this represents a limitation in has a significant carbon for prompt engineering in the next choosing the right prompt the words that best define the task so that the model is able to perform is also based on trial and this also has an impact on carbon in connection with this strubell et argue that improvements in the racy of models depend on the availability of large computational which involve large economic and environmental a criticism has been made as rich get in the sense that not all research groups have sufficient infrastructure resources and access to funding needed to use these models and improve their also in relation to this the work of bender et evaluates the costs and risks of the use of large language stating that researchers should be aware of the impact that these models have on the and assess whether the benefits outweigh the the work in provides a very telling where people living in the maldives or sudan are affected by floods and pay the environmental price of training english when similar models have not been produced for languages like dhivehi or sudanese in there is a need to establish ways to use this technological development and it all starts with being aware of the risks it with for each we got the frame that the model considered the most and we compared these inferences with the frames labeled by the the agreement between model and annotator was of analyzing the and specifically looking at the cases where the annotator and we discovered that according to the frame the model in some cases proposed a frame that indeed made this together with our previous experience in the annotation where headlines could have more than one valid led us to design a second we took all the headlines where each of the two annotators had disagreed with and we asked the annotators to state whether they would agree with each label for a given it is important to emphasize that the annotators did not know the origin of that they did not know if it was the label they had originally or if it was a random in this we could quantify how worked according to valid arguments provided by the in this the model agreed in of cases with the looking at the results of the classification the racy of the approach can be considered yet we consider that it is a valid avenue for further as in the second we found that the model agrees icmr june greece david alonso del barrio and daniel with human annotators in of the framing volves aspects of subjectivity much of what we do as people has a subjective influenced by how we feel or how we express news reading is never fully and the annotators gaged in the frame classification influenced by their personal state of and may perceive information monarch affirms that simple like binary labels on objective the statistics are fairly straightforward to decide which is the label when different annotators but for subjective or even objective tasks with continuous there are no simple heuristics for deciding what the correct label should subjectivity is involved in both the generation and perception of the assumption that there is only one frame is plicated by the point of view of the in the case of the information sender has an but the receiver plays a role and is influenced by in this is known as the lens model of interpersonal where the sender has certain but the receiver can interpret or what the sender wants to with more or less accuracy following this discussion on the question arose as to what would happen instead of we used the complete article as a source of we wondered if longer text could make the frame labeling task clearer than when using yet another possible hypothesis is that having to read longer texts could lead to the same subject being presented from different please recall that in the existing literature discussed in section both headlines and full articles have been used from frame analysis table this remains as an issue for future conclusions in this we first presented an analysis of news frames on the movement in and then studied different approaches using large language models for automatic inference of we conclude by answering the two research questions we what are the main frames in the news headlines about the movement in european after annotating the we found that of the the predominant frame is human interest of which presents a news item with an emotional putting a face to a problem or we also found that a substantial proportion of headlines were annotated as not presenting any frame of the other frame types are found more can prompt engineering be used for classification of lines according to we first used of a number of language and found that produced classification curacy of on a classification this represented a modest improvement over at a significantly larger environmental we then presented a new way of fying frames using at the headline inferences made with reached of agreement with frame in many the model inferred frame types that were considered as valid choices by human and in an the agreement reached these results have opened several new directions for future acknowledgments this work was supported by the funded by the european commission under the programme we also thank the newspapers
