        "abstract": "Identifying the frames of news is important to understand the articles vision, intention, message to be conveyed, and which aspects of the news are emphasized. Framing is a widely studied concept in journalism, and has emerged as a new topic in computing, with the potential to automate processes and facilitate the work of journalism professionals. In this paper, we study this issue with articles related to the Covid19 antivaccine movement. First, to understand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocol for human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No Vax movement articles of European newspapers from 5 countries. Headlines are key units in the written press, and worth of analysis as many people only read headlines (or use them to guide their decision for further reading.) Second, considering advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with large language models, we investigated two approaches for frame inference of news headlines: first with a GPT3.5 finetuning approach, and second with GPT 3.5 promptengineering. Our work contributes to the study and analysis of the performance that these models have to facilitate journalistic tasks like classification of frames, while understanding whether the models are able to replicate human perception in the identification of these frames."

In Section 3, we describe the news dataset. In Section 4, we describe the methodology for both human labeling and machine classification of news frames. We present and discuss results for RQ1 and RQ2 in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, we provide conclusions in Section 7. 2 RELATED WORK Framing has been a concept widely studied in journalism, with a definition that is rooted in the study of this domain [23]: To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a par ticular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described. For frame recognition, there are two main approaches: the induc tive approach [16], where one can extract the frames after reading the article, and the deductive approach [38], where a predefined list of frames exists and the goal is to interpret if any of them ap pears in the article. In the deductive case, there are generic frames and subjectspecific frames, and the way to detect them typically involves reading and identifying one frame at a time, or through answers to yes/no questions that represent the frames. Semetko et al. [52] used 5 types of generic frames (attribution of responsibility, human interest, conflict, morality, and economic consequences) based on previous literature, and they defined a list of 20 yes/no questions to detect frames in articles. For instance, the questions about morality are the following: \"Does the story contain any moral message? Does the story make reference to morality, God, and other religious tenets? Does the story offer specific social prescriptions about how to behave?\", and so on for each of the frame types. This categorization of frames has been used in various topics such as climate change [18] [19], vaccine hesitance [13], or immigration [34]. We now compare the two approaches on a common topic, such as Covid19. Ebrahim et al. [21] followed an inductive approach in which the frames were not predefined but emerged from the text (e.g., deadly spread, stay home, what if, the cost of Covid19) using headlines as the unit of analysis. In contrast, the deductive approach has studied very different labels. ElBehary et al. [22] followed the method of yes/no questions, but in addition to the 5 generic frames presented before, they also used blame frame and fear frame. Adiprasetio et al. [1] and Rodelo [50] used the 5 generic frames with yes/no questions, while Catal\u00e1nMatamoros et al. [14] used the 5 frames and read the headline and subheadline to decide the main frame. Table 1 summarizes some of the the existing approaches. This previous work showed how frame labels can be different, and also that frame analysis has been done at both headline and article levels. These two approaches (inductive and deductive) that originated in journalism have since been replicated in the computing literature. We decided to follow the deductive approach because a prede fined list of frames allows to compare among topics, countries, previous literature, and also because they represent a fixed list of labels for machine classification models. Furthermore, the induc tive approach tends to be more specific to a topic, and from the computing viewpoint, past work has tried to justify topic modeling as a technique to extract frames from articles. Yl\u00e4Antitila et al. [60] proposed topic modeling as a frame ex traction technique. They argued that topics can be interpreted as frames if three requirements are met: frames are operationalized as connections between concepts; subjectspecific data is selected; and topics are adequately validated as frames, for which they suggested a practical procedure. This approach was based on the choice of a specific topic (e.g., climate change) and the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as a technique to extract a number of subtopics. In a second phase, a qualitative study of the top 10 words of each subtopic was performed, and the different subtopics were elimi nated or grouped, reducing the number and establishing a tentative description. In a third phase, the top 10 articles belonging to that frame/topic were taken, and if the description of the topic fitted at least 8 of the 10 articles, that topic/frame remained. The frames found in this article were: green growth, emission cuts, negotiations and treaties, environmental risk, cost of carbon emissions, Chinese emissions, economics of energy production, climate change, en vironmental activism, NorthSouth burden sharing, state leaders negotiating, and citizen participation. From Entmans definition of frame [23], it seems that the deduc tive approach is more refined than the inductive approach (which seems to resemble the detection of subthemes.) For example, with regard to climate change, there are stories on how people have been affected by climate change from an emotional point of view, thus personalizing the problem. In this case, we could categorize the corresponding frame as human interest, as the writer of the article is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality and make them 628 Framing the News: From Human Perception to Large Language Model Inferences ICMR 23, June 1215, 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece more salient\". The language subtleties with which news articles are presented cannot be captured with basic topic modeling. Isoaho et al.[30] held the position that while the benefits of scale and scope in topic modeling were clear, there were also a number of problems, namely that topic outputs do not correspond to the methodological definition of frames, and thus topic modeling remained an incomplete method for frame analysis. Topic modeling, in the practice of journalistic research, is a useful technique to deal with the large datasets that are available, yet is often not enough to do more thorough analyses [31]. In our work, we clearly notice that frame analysis is not topic modeling. For example, two documents could be about the same topic, say Covid19 vaccination, but one article could emphasize the number of deaths after vaccination, while the other emphasized the role of the vaccine as a solution to the epidemic. We also consider that the larger the number of possible frame types, the more likely it is to end up doing topic modeling instead of frame analysis. Using a deductive approach, Dallas et al. [12] created a dataset with articles about polemic topics such as immigration, same sex marriage, or smoking, and they defined 15 types of frames: \"economic, capacity and resources, morality, fairness and equality, legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence, policy prescription and evaluation, crime and punishment, security and defense, health and safety, quality of life, cultural identity, political, external regulation and reputation, other\". In this case, they authors did not use a list of questions. Instead, for each article, annotators were asked to identify any of the 15 framing dimensions present in the article and to label text blurbs that cued them (based on the definitions of each of the frame dimensions) and decide the main frame of each article. In our case, we followed the idea of detecting the main frame by reading the text instead of answering questions, but instead of using the 15 frames proposed in [12] , we used the 5 generic frames proposed in [52]. A final decision in our work was the type of text to analyze, whether headlines or whole article. For this decision, the chosen classification method was also going to be important. For example, Khanehzar et al. [33] used traditional approaches such as SVMs as baseline, and demonstrated the improvement in frame classifica tion with the use of pretrained languages models such as BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet, following a finetuning approach, setting as input text a maximum of 256 tokens (although the maximum number of input tokens in these models is 512 tokens.) Liu et al. [37] classified news headlines about the gun problem in the United States, arguing for the choice of headlines as a unit of analysis based on previous journalism literature [6], [44], that advocated for the importance and influence of headlines on readers and the subsequent perception of articles. From a computational viewpoint, using headlines is also an advantage, since you avoid the 512 token limitation in BERTbased models. Therefore, we decided to work with headlines about a controversial issue, namely the Covid19 novax movement. Continuing with the question of the methods used for classi fication, much work has been developed in prompt engineering, especially since the release of GPT",

Prompt engineering applications include knowledge probing [46], information extraction [53], NLP reasoning [57], ques tion answering [32], text generation [20], multimodal learning [58], and text classification [24], the latter being the promptengineering use case in our work. Puri et al.[45] presented a very interesting idea that we apply to our classification task. This consists of pro viding the language model with natural language descriptions of classification tasks as input, and training it to generate the correct answer in natural language via a language modeling objective. It is a zeroshot learning approach, in which no examples are used to explain the task to the model. Radford et al. [48] demonstrated that language models can learn tasks without any explicit supervision. We have followed this approach to find an alternative way to do frame analysis. As mentioned before, the emergence of giant models like GPT3, BLOOM, and ChatGPT are a very active research topic. To the best of our knowledge, on one hand our work extends the computational analysis of news related to the covid19 novax movement, which illustrates the influence of the press on the ways societies think about relevant issues [40], [59], and on the other hand it adds to the literature of humanmachine interaction, regarding the design of GPT3 prompts for classification tasks [39], [2]. 3 DATA: EUROPEAN COVID19 NEWS DATASET We used part of the European Covid19 News dataset collected in our recent work [3]. This dataset contains 51320 articles on Covid 19 vaccination from 19 newspapers from 5 different countries: Italy, 629 ICMR 23, June 1215, 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece David Alonso del Barrio and Daniel GaticaPerez France, Spain, Switzerland and UK. The articles cover a time period of 22 months, from January 2020 to October 2021. All content was translated into English to be able to work in a common language. The dataset was used for various analyses, such as name entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and subtopic modeling, to under stand how Covid19 vaccination was reported in Europe through the print media (in digital format.) The subtopic modeling analysis revealed a subsample of articles on the novax movement, which is the one we have used in this paper. We took the headlines of the articles associated with the novax movement, selecting all articles containing any of the keywords in Table 2 in the headline or in the main text. This corresponds to a total of 1786 headlines. Table 2: Keywords used to identify novax articles Keywords NO VAX TOPIC \"antivaxxers\", \"antivaccine\", \"antivaxx\", \"anticorona\", \"novax\", \"no vax\",\"antivaccin\" In Table 3, we show the number of headlines per country and newspaper. France is the country with the most novax articles in the corpus, with 523 articles, followed by Italy with 508. However, note that there are 6 newspapers from France, while only 2 from Italy. Corriere della Sera is the newspaper that dealt most frequently with the subject (429 articles), while The Telegraph is the second one (206 articles). The total number of articles normalized by the number of newspapers per country is also shown in the last column of the Table. Using these normalized values, the ranking is Italy, UK, France, Switzerland, and Spain. Table 3: Number of headlines by newspaper and country COUNTRY NEWSPAPER HEADLINES TOTAL (NORM.

        "4.1 Human labeling of news frames": "To carry out the labeling of the frames in our corpus of headlines, we first designed a codebook, which contained the definitions of each of the frame types and a couple of examples of each type, as well as a definition of the corpus subject matter and definitions of the concept of frame analysis, so that the annotators could understand the task to be performed. The codebook follows the proposed by [52] with 5 generic frames (attribution of responsibility, human interest, conflict, morality, and economic consequences) plus one additional noframe category. Two researchers were engaged to annotate a sample of the collected newspaper articles following a threephase training procedure. In the first phase, annotators had to read the codebook and get familiar with the task. In the second phase, they were asked to identify the main frame in the same subset of 50 headlines. At the end of the second phase, the intercoder reliability (ICR) was 0.58 between the 2 annotators. We analyzed those cases where there were discrepancies, and observed that in some cases, there was not a unique main frame, because both annotators had valid arguments to select one of the frames. In other cases, the discrepancies were due to slight misunderstanding of the definitions. In the third phase, the annotators coded again 50 headlines, and the ICR increased to was 0.66. We realized that the possibility of having two frames remained. They discussed the cases in which they had disagreed, and if the other persons arguments were considered valid, it could be said that there were two frames. After this threephase training procedure, annotators were ready to annotate the dataset independently. We divided the dataset into two equal parts, and each person annotated 893 headlines.",
        "4.2 Finetuning GPT3": ".5 and BERTbased models With the annotated dataset, we investigated two NLP approaches: the first one involves finetuning a pretrained model; the second one is prompt engineering. Pretrained language models have been Figure 1: Pretrain, finetune, prompt trained with large text strings based on two unsupervised tasks, next sentence prediction and masked language model. Figure 1 summarizes these techniques. In the first approach, a model with a fixed architecture is pre trained as a language model (LM), predicting the likelihood of the observed textual data. This can be done due to the availability of large, raw text data needed to train LMs. This learning process can produce general purpose features of the modeled language. The learning process produces robust, generalpurpose features of the language being modeled. The above pretrained LM is then adapted to different downstream tasks, by introducing additional parameters and adjusting them using taskspecific objective functions. In this approach, the focus was primarily on goal engineering, designing the training targets used in both the pretraining and the finetuning stages [36]. 630 Framing the News: From Human Perception to Large Language Model Inferences ICMR 23, June 1215, 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece We present an example to illustrate the idea. Imagine that the task is sentiment analysis, and we have a dataset with sentences and their associated sentiment, and a pretrained model, which is a saved neural network trained with a much larger dataset. For that pretrained model to address the target task, we unfreeze a few of the top layers of the saved model base and jointly train both the newlyadded classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This allows to \"finetune\" the higherorder feature representations in the base model to make them more relevant for the sentiment analysis task. In this way, instead of having to obtain a very large dataset with target labels to train a model, we can reuse the pre trained model and use a much smaller train dataset. We use a part of our dataset as examples for the model to learn the task, while the other part of the dataset is used to evaluate model performance. Previous works related to frame classification in the computing literature have used finetuning, BERTbased models. In our work, we have done the same as a baseline, but we aimed to go one step further and also produce results using finetuning of GPT3.5.",
        "4.3 Promptengineering with GPT3": ".5 Model finetuning has been widely used, but with the emergence of generative models such as GPT3, another way to approach classification tasks has appeared. The idea is to use the pretrained model directly and convert the task to be performed into a format as close as possible to the tasks for which it has been pretrained. That is, if the model has been pretrained from next word prediction as in the case of GPT3, classification can be done by defining a prompt, where the input to the model is an incomplete sentence, and the model must complete it with a word or several words, just as it has been trained. This avoids having to use part of the already labeled dataset to teach the task to be performed to the model, and a previous labeling is not needed [36]. In this approach, instead of adapting pretrained LMs to down stream tasks via objective engineering, downstream tasks are re formulated to look more like those solved during the original LM training with the help of a textual prompt. For example, when recog nizing the emotion of a social media post, I missed the bus today., we may continue with a prompt I felt so _, and ask the LM to fill the blank with an emotionbearing word. Or if we choose the prompt English: I missed the bus today. French: _), an LM may be able to fill in the blank with a French translation. In this way, by selecting the appropriate prompts, we can influence the model behavior so that the pretrained LM itself can be used to predict the desired output, even without any additional taskspecific training [36]. We use this emerging NLP approach to classify frames at headline level. We are not aware of previous uses of this strategy to classify frames as we propose here. The idea is the following. Prompt engi neering consists of giving a prompt to the model, and understands that prompt as an incomplete sentence. To do prompt engineer ing with our dataset, we needed to define an appropriate prompt that would produce the headline frames as output. We defined sev eral experiments with the Playground of GPT3, in order to find the best prompt for our task. In our initial experiments, we fol lowed existing approaches in prompt engineering to do sentiment analysis, where the individual answer was an adjective, and this adjective was matched with a sentiment. In a similar fashion, we decided to build a thesaurus of adjectives that define each of the frames. For instance, the human interest frame could be interest ing, emotional, personal, human. The conflict frame could be: conflictive, bellicose, troublesome, rowdy, quarrelsome, trou blemaker, agitator, etc. After the list of adjectives was defined, we needed to define the prompt in order to get, as an answer, one of the adjectives in our thesaurus to match them with the frame. We used the GPT3 playground using the headline as input and asking for the frame as output, but the strategy did not work. In our final experiment, instead of giving the headline as input, we gave the definitions of each type of frame plus the headline, and we asked the model to choose between the different types of frames as output. In this way, the output of the model was directly one of the frames, and we avoided the step of matching adjectives with frames. An example is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: GPT3.5 for frame inference: input and output For the GPT3 configuration 1, there are 3 main concepts: TEMPERATURE [01]. This parameter controls randomness, lowering it results in less random completions. TOP_P [01]. This parameter controls diversity via nucleus sampling. MAX_TOKENS[14000]. This parameter indicates the maxi mum number of tokens to generate, MODEL. GPT3 offer four main models with different levels of power, suitable for different tasks. Davinci is the most capable model, and Ada is the fastest. After testing with the GPT3 playground and varying different hyperparameters to assess performance, we set the temperature to 0, since the higher the temperature the more random the response. Furthermore, the Topp parameter was set to 1, as it would likely get a set of the most likely words for the model to choose from. The maximum number of tokens was set to 2; in this way, the model is asked to choose between one of the responses. As a model, we used the one with the best performance at the time of experimental design, which was TEXTDAVINCI003, recognized as GPT 3.5. 5 RESULTS: HUMAN LABELING OF FRAMES IN NOVAX NEWS HEADLINES (RQ1) In this section, we present and discuss the results of the analysis related to our first RQ. Figure 3 shows the distribution of frames per country at headline level, with human interest and noframe being the predominant 1https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction 631 ICMR 23, June 1215, 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece David Alonso del Barrio and Daniel GaticaPerez ones. Attribution of responsibility is the third one except in Switzer land, where the corresponding frame is conflict. Finally, morality and economic are the least represented in the dataset for every country. Figure 3: Nonnormalized distribution of frames per country The monthly distribution of frames aggregated for all countries is shown in Fig.",
        "4. We can see two big peaks, the first one in January": "2021 and the second one in August 2021. In all countries, the vac cination process started at the end of December 2020, so it makes sense that the novax movement started to be more predominant in the news in January 2021. Human interest is the most predominant frame. Manual inspection shows that this is because the headlines are about personal cases of people who are pro or anti vaccine. Attribution of responsibility is also present. Manual inspection in dicates that local politicians and health authorities had to make decisions about who could be vaccinated at the beginning of the process. The second peak at the end of summer 2021 coincided with the health pass (also called Covid passport in some countries), and we can observe a peak in the curve corresponding to the con flict frame, reflecting the demonstrations against the measure of mandatory health passes taken by country governments. In Figure 5, we compare the sentiment per frame and per country, to understand if there were any major differences. The sentiment analysis labels were obtained using BERTsent from the Hugging Face package [47], used in our previous work (please refer to our original analysis in [3] for details.) We normalized the results be tween 0 and 1 to compare frames between countries. We see that the sentiment is predominantly neutral (in blue). Examining in more Figure 4: Nonnormalized monthly distribution of frames. detail the negative and positive sentiment of each frame category, we observed a few trends: Attribution of responsibility: Negative sentiment represents 3040% of the cases, while positive tone is only found in residual form in Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Conflict: Negative sentiment represents 2035% of the cases. Economic: Predominantly neutral, with only negative tone in Italy and UK (in the latter case, all headlines with this frame were considered negative.) Human interest: Negative sentiment represents 3040% of the cases, while positive tone is only found in residual form in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. Morality: Predominantly neutral, with negative tone in Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, No frame: 2030% of negative content. Figure 5: Sentiment of headline by frame and by country 632 Framing the News: From Human Perception to Large Language Model Inferences ICMR 23, June 1215, 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece Regarding the results of the annotation process, the fact that the distribution of the 6 frame types is relatively similar between coun tries suggests that the antivaccine movement issue was treated in a similar way in these countries. The fact that human interest is the most dominant frame indicates that this issue was treated from a more human and emotional approach, with headlines about personal experiences, celebrities giving their opinion about vacci nation, and politicians defending vaccine policies. Moreover, the reason for many headlines being classified as noframe is partly due to how data was selected. We chose articles that contained words related to novax, either in the headline or in the article. This resulted in many headlines not containing anything specific related to novax, while the novax content was actually included in the main text of the corresponding articles. It is worth mentioning that prior to obtaining the results, we had expected that attribution of responsibility would be among the most prominent frames, since governments took many measures such as mandatory health pass requirements to access certain sites; we had also expected that the conflict frame would be prominent, since there were many demonstrations in Europe. In reality, however, these frames categories were not reflected as frequently at the headline level. Regarding the analysis at the temporal level, it is clear that certain events were captured by the press, such as the start of vaccination or the mandatory vaccination passport. Finally, the sentiment analysis of the different frames shows that the predominant tone in all of them is neutral or negative, with very similar trends between countries. This association between senti ment analysis and frames has been discussed in previous literature [11] [43]. 6 RESULTS: GPT3.5 FOR FRAME CLASSIFICATION OF HEADLINES (RQ2) Here, we present and discuss the results related to our second RQ. 6.1 Finetuning GPT3.5 Table 4 shows the results of the 6class classification task using 5cross validation. Three models were used: GPT3.5 and two BERT based models. We observe that, on average, GPT3.5 performs better than the BERTbased models. This is somehow expected as GPT 3.5 is a much larger model. Overall, in the case of finetuning, the best performance for the sixclass frame classification task is 72% accuracy, which is promising, with an improvement over previous models based on BERT. Yet, it should be noted that the performance differences are modest (2% improvement between GPT3.5 and RoBERTa). Table 4: Classification results for sixclass frame classifica tion and 5fold cross validation ACCURACY 0 1 2 3 4 AVERAGE BERT 0.68 0.69 0.72 0.64 0.70 0.67 RoBERTa 0.70 0.72 0.72 0.67 0.71 0.70 GPT3 0.75 0.70 0.72 0.71 0.71 0.72 On the other hand, BERT is opensource, while GPT3 has an economic cost as the use of the model is not free, which monetarily limits the number of experiments that can be performed with it, as well as the different configurations one can explore to improve performance. This is important because much of the improvement in performance requires empirical explorations of model parameters More specifically, the cost of an experiment for each of the folds has a cost of 4 dollars (at the time of writing this paper.) This represents a limitation in practice. Furthermore, GPT3 has a significant carbon footprint. Similarly, for prompt engineering (discussed in the next subsection), choosing the right prompt (i.e., the words that best define the task so that the model is able to perform adequately) is also based on trial and error. This also has an impact on carbon footprint. In connection with this topic, Strubell et al.[55] argue that improvements in the accu racy of models depend on the availability of large computational resources, which involve large economic and environmental costs. A criticism has been made as the rich get richer, in the sense that not all research groups have sufficient infrastructure resources and access to funding needed to use these models and improve their performance. Also in relation to this analysis, the work of Bender et al. [4] evaluates the costs and risks of the use of large language models, stating that researchers should be aware of the impact that these models have on the environment, and assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks. The work in [4] provides a very telling example, where people living in the Maldives or Sudan are affected by floods and pay the environmental price of training English LLMs, when similar models have not been produced for languages like Dhivehi or Sudanese Arab. In short, there is a need to establish ways to use this technological development responsibly, and it all starts with being aware of the risks it presents. 6.2 Promptengineering with GPT3.5 For each headline, we got the frame that the model considered the most likely, and we compared these GPT3.5 inferences with the frames labeled by the annotators. The agreement between model and annotator was of 49%. Analyzing the results, and specifically looking at the cases where the annotator and GPT3.5 disagreed, we discovered that according to the frame definitions, the model in some cases proposed a frame that indeed made sense. This ob servation, together with our previous experience in the annotation process, where headlines could have more than one valid frame, led us to design a second posthoc experiment. We took all the headlines where each of the two annotators had disagreed with GPT3.5, and we asked the annotators to state whether they would agree (or not) with each GPTinferred label for a given headline. It is important to emphasize that the annotators did not know the origin of that label, i.e., they did not know if it was the label they had originally assigned, or if it was a random one. In this way, we could quantify how GPT3.5 worked according to valid arguments provided by the annotators. In this posthoc experiment, the model agreed in 76% of cases with the annotators. Looking at the results of the classification models, the 49% accu racy of the promptengineering approach can be considered low, yet we consider that it is a valid avenue for further investigation, as in the second posthoc analysis, we found that the model agrees 633 ICMR 23, June 1215, 2023, Thessaloniki, Greece David Alonso del Barrio and Daniel GaticaPerez with human annotators in 76% of the cases. Clearly, framing in volves aspects of subjectivity [42]. Much of what we do as people has a subjective component, influenced by how we feel or how we express opinions. News reading is never fully objective, and the annotators en gaged in the frame classification task, influenced by their personal state of mind, experience, and culture, may perceive information differently. Monarch affirms that \"for simple tasks, like binary labels on objective tasks, the statistics are fairly straightforward to decide which is the correct label when different annotators disagree. But for subjective tasks, or even objective tasks with continuous data, there are no simple heuristics for deciding what the correct label should be\" [42]. Subjectivity is involved in both the generation and perception of information: the assumption that there is only one frame is com plicated by the point of view of the reader. In the case of news, the information sender (the journalist) has an intention, but the receiver (the reader) plays a role and is influenced by it. In psychology, this is known as the lens model of interpersonal communication, where the sender has certain objectives, but the receiver can interpret or reinterpret what the sender wants to say, with more or less accuracy [26]. Following this discussion on subjectivity, the question arose as to what would happen if, instead of headlines, we used the complete article as a source of analysis. We wondered if longer text could make the frame labeling task clearer than when using headlines. Yet another possible hypothesis is that having to read longer texts could lead to the same subject being presented from different angles. Please recall that in the existing literature discussed in Section 2, both headlines and full articles have been used from frame analysis (see Table 1.) This remains as an issue for future work. 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we first presented an analysis of humangenerated news frames on the covid19 novax movement in Europe, and then studied different approaches using large language models for automatic inference of frames. We conclude by answering the two research questions we posed: RQ1: What are the main frames in the news headlines about the covid19 antivaccine movement in 5 European countries? After annotating the headlines, we found that of the 1786 headlines, the predominant frame is human interest (45.3% of cases), which presents a news item with an emotional angle, putting a face to a problem or situation. We also found that a substantial proportion of headlines were annotated as not presenting any frame (40.2% of cases). Finally, the other frame types are found more infrequently. RQ2: Can prompt engineering be used for classification of head lines according to frames? We first used finetuning of a number of language models, and found that GPT3.5 produced classification ac curacy of 72% on a sixframe classification task. This represented a modest 2% improvement over BERTbased models, at a significantly larger environmental cost. We then presented a new way of classi fying frames using prompts. At the headline level, inferences made with GPT3.5 reached 49% of agreement with humangenerated frame labels. In many cases, the GPT3.5 model inferred frame types that were considered as valid choices by human annotators, and in an postdoc experiment, the humanmachine agreement reached 76%. These results have opened several new directions for future work.
