    "abstract": "Identifying the frames of news is important to understand the articles vision, intention, message to be conveyed, and which aspects of the news are emphasized. Framing is a widely studied concept in journalism, and has emerged as a new topic in computing, with the potential to automate processes and facilitate the work of journalism professionals. In this paper, we study this issue with articles related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement. First, to understand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocol for human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No-Vax movement articles of European newspapers from 5 countries. Headlines are key units in the written press, and worth of analysis as many people only read headlines (or use them to guide their decision for further reading.) Second, considering advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with large language models, we investigated two approaches for frame inference of news headlines: first with a GPT-3.5 fine-tuning approach, and second with GPT-3.5 prompt-engineering. Our work contributes to the study and analysis of the performance that these models have to facilitate journalistic tasks like classification of frames, while understanding whether the models are able to replicate human perception in the identification of these frames.",
    "content": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation in the use of concepts such as data journalism, computational journalism, and computer-assisted reporting [15] [29], which all share the vision of bridging journalism and technology. The progress made in NLP has been gradually integrated into the journalistic field [5][8][54]. More specifically, machine learning models based on transformers have been integrated in the media sector in different tasks [41] such as the creation of headlines with generative languages models [17], summarization of news articles [28][27], false news detection [49], and topic modeling and sentiment analysis [25]. The development of large language models such as GPT-3 [9], BLOOM [51] or ChatGPT show a clear trend towards human-machine interaction becoming easier and more intuitive, opening up a wide range of research possibilities. At the same time, the use of these models is also associated with a lack of transparency regarding how these models work, but efforts are being made to bring some transparency to these models, and to analyze use cases where they can be useful and where they cannot [35]. Based on the premises that these models open up a wide range of research directions [7], and that at the same time (and needless to say) they are not the solution to all problems, we are interested in identifying use cases and tasks where they can be potentially useful, while acknowledging and systematically documenting their limitations [56]. More specifically, the aim of this work is to analyze the performance of GPT-3.5 for a specific use case, namely the analysis of frames in news, from an empirical point of view, with the objective of shedding light on a potential use of generative models in journalistic tasks. Frame analysis is a concept from journalism, which consists of studying the way in which news stories are presented on an issue, and what aspects are emphasized: Is a merely informative vision given in an article? Or is it intended to leave a moral lesson? Is a news article being presented from an economic point of view? Or from a more human, emotional angle? The examples above correspond to different frames with which an article can be written. The concept of news framing has been studied in computing as a step beyond topic modeling and sentiment analysis, and for this purpose, in recent years, pre-trained language models have been used for fine-tuning the classification process of these frames [60] [10], but the emergence of generative models opens the possibility of doing prompt-engineering of these classification tasks, instead of the fine-tuning approach investigated so far. Our work aims to address this research gap by posing the following research questions: RQ1: What are the main frames in the news headlines about the anti-vaccine movement, as reported in newspapers across 5 European countries? 627"
