The quality of UML models can be improved by apply- ing gamified activities and providing guidelines aware of quality issues. A qualitative questionnaire was answered by 19 instructors who teach software modeling at higher education institutions. The results show that (1) 94.7% recognize that the proposed model can improve the quality of UML models, indicating that they would adopt the ModelGame in their learning practices; and (2) 47.4% do not use any gamification mechanics in their classes.

This adoption seeks, for example, to improve the en- gagement of developers while creating UML models or writing code. Empirical studies [7, 9, 14] report that UML models suffer from incompleteness and inconsistency problems. Lange [14] rein- forces that these defects bring potential risks that can cause mis- interpretation and communication failure, representing a risk to software quality. Thus, finding formats that favor student learning and consequently in generating increasingly effective UML mod- els can become one of the main challenges faced by instructors that include UML (Unified Modeling Language) as part of software modeling content.",

It was identified that most have not yet used gamification in their classes, but agree that their use can contribute to the quality of the models developed by the stu- dents and were open to using the model. Our findings can enhance the adoption of new teaching practices through gamification, result- ing in the improvement of software modeling learning using UML, and consequently the creation of models developed by students. These approaches can stimulate students\u2019 immersion in the design of systems as future professionals during learning.",
