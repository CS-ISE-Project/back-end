It is noteworthy that students chose not to rely too heavily on technology during the examinations despite the freedom to do so. The students found it extremely important to be competent with analytical mathematical skills as opposed to purely com- putational skills. Some revealed that they learn the subjects equally well without the help of scienti\ufb01c packages, although the perception towards the use of computer is in general highly positive.

        "text": "Limit is a fundamental concept in calculus. Students are usually taught to calculate limits using analytical approaches. Although analytical approaches work well, there is no single universal rule for calculating limits. On the other hand, in most cases, limits can be calculated numerically using essentially the same approach. To illustrate, suppose we want to calculate limx\u2192a+ f (x). Then we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f (a+ 10\u2212k). As k increases, a+ 10\u2212k approaches a, so f (a+ 10\u2212k) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. We can deduce the limit by observing the values of f (a + 10\u2212k) or determine that the limit does not exist if there is no pattern of convergence. The value of n can be chosen manually or using a stopping criterion. For instance, the algorithm may continue to iterate until the difference between consecutive values of f (a + 10\u2212k) is below a certain threshold. The value of the limit can also be deduced automatically based on the values of f (a + 10\u2212k) using various heuristics.",

As k increases, 10k approaches \u221e, so f (10k) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. Then the limit can be determined based on the values of f (10k). Various extensions and cus- tomizations of this basic approach can be made. For instance, to avoid issues with periodic functions f (10k + \u01ebk), where \u01ebk are randomly generated, can be used. Other values than 10k can also be used as long as the sequence approaches in\ufb01nity. A degree of automization can be introduced using different heuristics.",
