This adoption seeks, for example, to improve the en- gagement of developers while creating UML models or writing code. Empirical studies report that UML models suffer from incom- pleteness and inconsistency problems. This study conjectures that gamification mechanics can improve learner engagement while learning software modeling, mitigating such problems concern- ing UML models. The current literature lacks studies that explore gamification and UML model quality in the context of software modeling learning. This article, therefore, proposes ModelGame, which is a quality model to support software modeling learning in a gamified way. It serves as a reference framework so that instructors can obtain a parameterized way to evaluate UML models created by learners. The quality of UML models can be improved by apply- ing gamified activities and providing guidelines aware of quality issues. A qualitative questionnaire was answered by 19 instructors who teach software modeling at higher education institutions. The results show that (1) 94.7% recognize that the proposed model can improve the quality of UML models, indicating that they would adopt the ModelGame in their learning practices; and (2) 47.4% do not use any gamification mechanics in their classes. The results are encouraging, showing the potential for applying and improving the teaching and learning of software modeling.",

Games are most often used to cover \u201cSoftware Process\u201d and \u201cProject Man- agement\u201d. The most commonly used game elements are points, quizzes, and challenges. The results also show that the main rea- sons for not adopting the resources are the lack of knowledge, information about games relevant to the engineering of teaching software, and the lack of time to plan and include these approaches in the classroom.",

        "text": "This study proposed an initial quality model (ModelGame) that serves as a reference framework for instructors for qualitative eval- uations of UML models developed from gamified activities, the application of an empirical study with 19 participants was carried out to understand their vision in relation to gamification and the acceptance of the proposed Model. It was identified that most have not yet used gamification in their classes, but agree that their use can contribute to the quality of the models developed by the stu- dents and were open to using the model. Our findings can enhance the adoption of new teaching practices through gamification, result- ing in the improvement of software modeling learning using UML, and consequently the creation of models developed by students. These approaches can stimulate students\u2019 immersion in the design of systems as future professionals during learning.",
