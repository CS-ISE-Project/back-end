Algorithms and data-structures are, however, implementation details. Algorithms are an essential design choice while programming in the small.

A module is marked as quantum if it uses quantum resources in any form, either directly as part of its internal implementation or as part of an aggregated module. If a sub-module (in UML a composed class or object) is quantum, then the encompassing module must also be marked as quantum.

To make this argument, we appeal to the fact that all quantum computation is simulable using classical computation albeit with an efficiency loss. Other than their use of quantum information and algorithms, quantum computers are indistinct from classical ones. Hence, from a high-level design perspective, the only information element that needs to be considered when developing quantum software is when quantum (rather than classical) information is being used.",
