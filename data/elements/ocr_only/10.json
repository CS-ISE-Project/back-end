        "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in soft- ware engineering to perform tasks such as translating code between programming languages, generating code from natural language, and autocompleting code as it is being written. When used within development tools, these systems typically treat each model in- vocation independently from all previous invocations, and only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface. This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model\u2019s responses. We developed a prototype system \u2014 the Programmer\u2019s Assistant \u2014 in order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code, as well as software engineers\u2019 receptiveness to the idea of conversing with, rather than invoking, a code-fluent LLM. Through an evaluation with 42 partici- pants with varied levels of programming experience, we found that our system was capable of conducting extended, multi-turn discus- sions, and that it enabled additional knowledge and capabilities beyond code generation to emerge from the LLM. Despite skepti- cal initial expectations for conversational programming assistance, participants were impressed by the breadth of the assistant\u2019s capa- bilities, the quality of its responses, and its potential for improving their productivity. Our work demonstrates the unique potential of conversational interactions with LLMs for co-creative processes like software development.",

Initially, four authors performed open-coding on the open-ended survey responses. Through discussion, these codes were grouped and consolidated into a single set, which were then re-applied to the data by two authors. After another round of discussion, these authors identified a set of 12 higher-level themes. Some themes had clear parallels to quantitative survey questions or event log data, and thus represented clear instances where we were able to trian- gulate across data sources. Other themes surprised us.

Other NCF categories were split to provide nuanced detail about the interaction; for example, we distinguished three different kinds of NCF requests, depending upon whether they were stated as Requests for Action (e.g. \u201cWould you...\u201d), Commands of Action (e.g. \u201cWrite a function that...\u201d), or Expressions of Desire (e.g. \u201cI want..\u201d\u201d).

In addition, through longitudinal use, we believe that human and AI partners can create reciprocal representations of one another \u2014 ie., the human is likely to create a mental model of the AI, and the AI may be engineered to develop a user model for each of its human users [30, 48, 79].

If the string is equal to its reversed self, then it is a palindrome, so the equality would hold True. User: Thanks! Socrates:You're welcome!
