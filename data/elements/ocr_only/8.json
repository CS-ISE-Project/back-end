Framing is a widely studied concept in journalism, and has emerged as a new topic in computing, with the potential to automate processes and facilitate the work of jour- nalism professionals. In this paper, we study this issue with articles related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement. First, to under- stand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocol for human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No- Vax movement articles of European newspapers from 5 countries. Headlines are key units in the written press, and worth of analysis as many people only read headlines (or use them to guide their decision for further reading.) Second, considering advances in Nat- ural Language Processing (NLP) with large language models, we investigated two approaches for frame inference of news headlines: first with a GPT-3.5 fine-tuning approach, and second with GPT- 3.5 prompt-engineering. Our work contributes to the study and analysis of the performance that these models have to facilitate journalistic tasks like classification of frames, while understanding whether the models are able to replicate human perception in the identification of these frames.",

We implemented a process to do human an- notation of the main frame of 1786 headlines of articles about the Covid-19 no-vax movement, as reported in 19 newspapers from 5 European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom.) At the headline level, we found that the predominant frame was human interest, where this frame corresponds to a per- sonification of an event, either through a statement by a person, or the explanation of a specific event that happened to a person. Furthermore, we found a large number of headlines annotated as containing no frame, as they simply present information without entering into evaluations. We also found that for all the countries involved, the distribution of frame types was very similar, i.e., hu- man interest and no frame are the two predominant frames. Finally, the generated annotations allowed to subsequently study the per- formance of a large language model.",

The results show that fine-tuning with GPT-3.5 produces 72% accuracy (slightly higher than other smaller models), and that the prompt- engineering approach results in lower performance (49% accuracy.)

In the deductive case, there are generic frames and subject-specific frames, and the way to detect them typically involves reading and identifying one frame at a time, or through answers to yes/no questions that represent the frames.

In contrast, the deductive approach has studied very different labels. El-Behary et al. [22] followed the method of yes/no questions, but in addition to the 5 generic frames presented before, they also used blame frame and fear frame. Adiprasetio et al.

Using a deductive approach, Dallas et al. [12] created a dataset with articles about polemic topics such as immigration, same sex marriage, or smoking, and they defined 15 types of frames: \"economic, capacity and resources, morality, fairness and equality, legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence, policy prescription and evaluation, crime and punishment, security and defense, health and safety, quality of life, cultural identity, political, external regulation and reputation, other\". In this case, they authors did not use a list of questions. Instead, for each article, annotators were asked to identify any of the 15 framing dimensions present in the article and to label text blurbs that cued them (based on the definitions of each of the frame dimensions) and decide the main frame of each article. In our case, we followed the idea of detecting the main frame y reading the text instead of answering questions, but instead of using the 15 frames proposed in [12] , we used the 5 generic frames roposed in [52].",

For example, Khanehzar et al. [33] used traditional approaches such as SVMs as aseline, and demonstrated the improvement in frame classifica- tion with the use of pre-trained languages models such as BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet, following a fine-tuning approach, setting as input text a maximum of 256 tokens (although the maximum number of input tokens in these models is 512 tokens.) Liu et al. 37] classified news headlines about the gun problem in the United States, arguing for the choice of headlines as a unit of analysis ased on previous journalism literature [6], [44], that advocated for the importance and influence of headlines on readers and the subsequent perception of articles. From a computational viewpoint, using headlines is also an advantage, since you avoid the 512 token imitation in BERT-based models. Therefore, we decided to work with headlines about a controversial issue, namely the Covid-19 no-vax movement.",

Puri et al.[45] presented a very interesting idea that we apply to our classification task. This consists of pro- viding the language model with natural language descriptions of classification tasks as input, and training it to generate the correct answer in natural language via a language modeling objective. It is a zero-shot learning approach, in which no examples are used to explain the task to the model. Radford et al.

This allows to \"fine-tune\" the higher-order feature representations in the base model to make them more relevant for the sentiment analysis task. In this way, instead of having to obtain a very large dataset with target labels to train a model, we can reuse the pre- trained model and use a much smaller train dataset.

That is, if the model has been pre-trained from next word prediction as in the case of GPT-3, classification can be done by defining a prompt, where the input to the model is an incomplete sentence, and the model must complete it with a word or several words, just as it has been trained.

Or if we choose the prompt \u201cEnglish: I missed the bus today. French: _\u201d), an LM may be able to fill in the blank with a French translation. In this way, by selecting the appropriate prompts, we can influence the model behavior so that the pre-trained LM itself can be used to predict the desired output, even without any additional task-specific training [36].",

We used the GPT-3 playground using the headline as input and asking for the frame as output, but the strategy did not work. In our final experiment, instead of giving the headline as input, we gave the definitions of each type of frame plus the headline, and we asked the model to choose between the different types of frames as output.

Similarly, for prompt engineering (discussed in the next subsection), choosing the right prompt (i.e., the words that best define the task so that the model is able to perform adequately) is also based on trial and error. This also has an impact on carbon footprint. In connection with this topic, Strubell et al.[55] argue that improvements in the accu- racy of models depend on the availability of large computational resources, which involve large economic and environmental costs. A criticism has been made as \u2019the rich get richer\u2019, in the sense that not all research groups have sufficient infrastructure resources and access to funding needed to use these models and improve their performance. Also in relation to this analysis, the work of Bender et al. [4] evaluates the costs and risks of the use of large language models, stating that researchers should be aware of the impact that these models have on the environment, and assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks. The work in [4] provides a very telling example, where people living in the Maldives or Sudan are affected by floods and pay the environmental price of training English LLMs, when similar models have not been produced for languages like Dhivehi or Sudanese Arab.

This ob- servation, together with our previous experience in the annotation process, where headlines could have more than one valid frame, led us to design a second post-hoc experiment. We took all the headlines where each of the two annotators had disagreed with GPT-3.5, and we asked the annotators to state whether they would agree (or not) with each GPT-inferred label for a given headline. It is important to emphasize that the annotators did not know the origin of that label, i.e., they did not know if it was the label they had originally assigned, or if it was a random one. In this way, we could quantify how GPT-3.5 worked according to valid arguments provided by the annotators. In this post-hoc experiment, the model agreed in 76% of cases with the annotators.",
