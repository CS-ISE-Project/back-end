The students found it extremely important to be competent with analytical mathematical skills as opposed to purely com- putational skills. Some revealed that they learn the subjects equally well without the help of scientific packages, although the perception towards the use of computer is in general highly positive.

Then we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f(a+10-*). As k increases, a+ 10~* approaches a, so f (a+ 10-*) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. We can deduce the limit by observing the values of f(a +10~*) or determine that the limit does not exist if there is no pattern of convergence. The value of n can be chosen manually or using a stopping criterion. For instance, the algorithm may continue to iterate until the difference between consecutive values of f(a + 10-*) is below a certain threshold.
