        "text": "Making efficient AI models for games with imperfect information can be a particular challenge. Considering the large number of possible moves and the incorporated uncertainties building game trees for these games becomes very difficult due to the exponential growth of the number of nodes at each level. This effort is focused on presenting a method of combined Case Based Reasoning (CBR) with AI Planning which drastically reduces the size of game trees. Instead of looking at all possible combinations we can focus only on the moves that lead us to specific strategies in effect discarding meaningless moves. These strategies are selected by finding similarities to cases in the CBR database. The strategies are formed by a set of desired goals. The AI planning is responsible for creating a plan to reach these goals. The plan is basically a set of moves that brings the player to this goal. By following these steps and not regarding the vast number of other possible moves the model develops Game Trees which grows slower so they can be built with more feature moves restricted by the same amount of memory.",

At the beginning a description of Game AI algorithms are given; such as Game Trees and Minimax. The following section describes an approach of using AI Planning to improve building Game Trees imperfect information where Game Trees tend to be very large with high growth ratio. Section 4 discusses another approach that provides a significant reduction to the number of considered moves in order to find the favorable strategy of the AI player. This approach uses AI Planning techniques and Case Base Reasoning (CBR) to plan for different scenarios in predetermined strategies which would be analogous to human player experience in the particular game. The CBR database illustrates a set of past experiences for the AI problem and the AI Planning illustrates the procedure to deal with the given situation in the game. In the next two sections implementations and evaluations of both approaches are given. The AI Planning approach is implemented with the Tic-tac-toe game and the combined AI Planning and CBR approach is implemented with a model for the Monopoly game.

One of the basic strategies of the game is to build a set of properties that will bring constant income larger than the one of the opponents. So in time the opponents will have to declare bankruptcy. But on the other hand over investment can lead to too stretched resources with low income that will eventually drove the player to bankruptcy. To decide on these two we need a clear separation into two groups of cases in the CBR database. The first group of cases will represent a situation on the board where the player has significant income per loop formed of one or more color group properties, maybe railroads, some buildings on them and so on. It is important to note that in this case the player is better situated than his opponents so he only needs to survive long enough to win the game. In the other group of cases either the opponent is not well positioned on the board or its opponents are better situated. In this case further investments are necessary to improve the situation so the player can have a chance of winning in the long run.",
