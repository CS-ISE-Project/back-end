Then we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f (a+ 10\u2212k). As k increases, a+ 10\u2212k approaches a, so f (a+ 10\u2212k) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. We can deduce the limit by observing the values of f (a + 10\u2212k) or determine that the limit does not exist if there is no pattern of convergence. The value of n can be chosen manually or using a stopping criterion. For instance, the algorithm may continue to iterate until the difference between consecutive values of f (a + 10\u2212k) is below a certain threshold.

As k increases, 10k approaches \u221e, so f (10k) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. Then the limit can be determined based on the values of f (10k). Various extensions and cus- tomizations of this basic approach can be made. For instance, to avoid issues with periodic functions f (10k + \u01ebk), where \u01ebk are randomly generated, can be used. Other values than 10k can also be used as long as the sequence approaches in\ufb01nity. A degree of automization can be introduced using different heuristics.",
