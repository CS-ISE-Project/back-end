As a consequence, surrogate models have been recognized as a key tool for engineering tasks such as design space exploration, uncertainty quantification, and optimization [3]. In practice, surrogate models are used to reduce the computational effort of these tasks by replacing expensive numerical simulations with closed-form approxi- mations [4, Ch. 10]. To build such a model, we start by evaluating the original expensive simulation at a set of points through a Design of Experiments (DoE). Then, the corresponding evaluations are used to build the surrogate model according to the chosen approximation, such as Kriging, quadratic interpolation, or least squares regression.",

        "text": "There are two new major capabilities in SMT 2.0: the ability to build surrogate models involving mixed variables and the support for hierarchical variables within Kriging models. To handle mixed variables in Kriging models, existing libraries such as BoTorch [25], Dakota [26], DiceKriging [27], LVGP [28], Parmoo [29], and Spearmint [30] implement simple mixed models by using either continuous relax- ation (CR), also known as one-hot encoding [30], or a Gower distance (GD) based correlation kernel [31]. KerGP [32] (developed in R) imple- ments more general kernels but there is no Python open-source toolbox that implements more general kernels to deal with mixed variables, such as the homoscedastic hypersphere (HH) [33] and exponential homoscedastic hypersphere (EHH) [34] kernels. Such kernels require the tuning of a large number of hyperparameters but lead to more accurate Kriging surrogates than simpler mixed kernels [34,35]. SMT 2.0 implements all these kernels (CR, GD, HH, and EHH) through a unified framework and implementation. To handle hierarchical vari- ables, no library in the literature can build peculiar surrogate models except SMT 2.0, which implements two Kriging methods for these variables. Notwithstanding, most softwares are compatible with a na\u00efve strategy called the imputation method [24] but this method lacks depth and depends on arbitrary choices. This is why Hutter and Osborne [21] proposed a first kernel, called Arc-Kernel which in turn was generalized by Horn et al. [36] with a new kernel called the Wedge- Kernel [37]. None of these kernels are available in any open-source modeling software. Furthermore, thanks to the framework introduced in Audet et al. [38], our proposed kernels are sufficiently general so that all existing hierarchical kernels are included within it. Section 4 describes the two kernels implemented in SMT 2.0 that are referred as SMT Arc-Kernel and SMT Alg-Kernel. In particular, Alg- Kernel is a novel hierarchical kernel introduced in this paper. Table 1 outlines the main features of the state-of-the-art modeling software that can handle hierarchical and mixed variables.",

Three types of derivatives are distinguished: prediction derivatives, training derivatives, and output derivatives. SMT also includes new models with derivatives such as Kriging with Partial Least Squares (KPLS) [44] and Regularized Minimal-energy Tensor-product Spline (RMTS) [3].

SMT is orga- nized along three main sub-modules that implement a set of sampling techniques (sampling_methods), benchmarking functions (problems), and surrogate modeling techniques (surrogate_models). The toolbox documentation6 is created using reStructuredText and Sphinx, a doc- umentation generation package for Python, with custom extensions. Code snippets in the documentation pages are taken directly from actual tests in the source code and are automatically updated. The output from these code snippets and tables of options are generated dynamically by custom Sphinx extensions. This leads to high-quality documentation with minimal effort. Along with user documentation, developer documentation is also provided to explain how to contribute to SMT. This includes a list of API methods for the SurrogateModel, SamplingMethod, and Problem classes, that must be implemented to create a new surrogate modeling method, sampling technique, or benchmarking problem. When a developer submits a pull request, it is merged only after passing the automated tests and receiving approval from at least one reviewer. The repository on GitHub7 is linked to continuous integration tests (GitHub Actions) for Windows, Linux and MacOS, to a coverage test on coveralls.io and to a dependency version check for Python with DependaBot. Various parts of the source code have been accelerated using Numba [46], an LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler for numpy-heavy Python code. Numba is applied to con- ventional Python code using function decorators, thereby minimizing its impact on the development process and not requiring an additional build step. For a mixed Kriging surrogate with 150 training points, a speedup of up to 80% is observed, see Table 2. The JIT compilation step only needs to be done once when installing or upgrading SMT and adds an overhead of approximately 24 s on a typical workstation In this paper, all results are obtained using an Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20 GHz core and 128 GB of memory with a Broadwell- generation processor front-end and a compute node of a peak power of 844 GFlops.",

Design variables can either be continu- ous (FloatVariable), ordered (OrdinalVariable) or categorical (CategoricalVariable). The integer type (IntegerVariable) rep- resents a special case of the ordered variable, specified by bounds (inclusive) rather than a list of possible values. The hierarchical struc- ture of the design space can be defined using declare_decreed_var: this function declares that a variable is a decreed variable that is activated when the associated meta variable takes one of a set of specified values, see Section 4 for background. The DesignSpace class also implements mechanisms for sampling valid design vectors (i.e. design vectors that adhere to the hierarchical structure of the design space) using any of the below-mentioned samplers, for cor- recting and imputing design vectors, and for requesting which design variables are acting in a given design vector. Correction ensures that variables have valid values (e.g. integers for discrete variables) [24], and imputation replaces non-acting variables by some default value (0 for discrete variables, mid-way between the bounds for continuous variables in SMT 2.0) [47].",

For the four implemented methods, displacement error (computed with a root-mean-square error criterion), likelihood, number of hyperparameters and computational time for every model are shown in Table 4. For the continuous variables, we use the square exponential kernel. More details are found in [34]. As expected, the complex EHH and HH models lead to a lower displacement error and a higher likelihood value, but use more hyperparameters and increase the computational cost compared to GD and CR. On this test case, the kernel EHH is easier to optimize than HH but in general, they are similar in terms of performance. Also, by default SMT 2.0 uses CR as it is known to be a good trade-off between complexity and performance [59].",

        "text": "Assuming that the decreed variables are quantitative, Hutter and Osborne [21] proposed several kernels for the hierarchical context. A classic approach, called the imputation method (Imp-Kernel) leads to an efficient paradigm in practice that can be easily integrated into a more general framework as proposed by Bussemaker et al. [24]. However, this kernel lacks depth and depends on arbitrary choices. Therefore, Hutter and Osborne [21] also proposed a more general kernel, called Arc-Kernel and Horn et al. [36] generalized this kernel even more and proposed a new formulation called the Wedge- Kernel [37]. The drawbacks of these two methods are that they add some extra hyperparameters for every decreed dimension (respectively one extra hyperparameter for the Arc-Kernel and two hyperparam- eters for the Wedge-Kernel) and that they need a normalization according to the bounds. More recently, Pelamatti et al. [60] developed a hierarchical kernel for Bayesian optimization. However, our work is also more general thanks to the framework introduced earlier [38] that considers variable-wise formulation and is more flexible as we are allowing sub-problems to be intersecting.",

For this reason, the Arc-Kernel includes additional continuous hyperparameters which makes the training of the GP models more expensive and introduces more numerical stability issues. In this context, we are proposing a new algebraic meta-decreed kernel (denoted as Alg-Kernel) that enjoys similar properties as Arc-Kernel but without using additional continuous hyperparameters nor rescaling.

[60], we chose to model \ud835\udc655 and \ud835\udc642 as neutral variables even if \ud835\udc53 does not depend on \ud835\udc655 when \ud835\udc642 = 0. Other modeling choices are kept; for example, \ud835\udc642 is a so-called \u2018\u2018binary variable\u2019\u2019 and not a categorical one [71]. Similarly, we also keep the formulation of \ud835\udc641 as a categorical variable but a better model would be to model it as a \u2018\u2018cyclic variable\u2019\u2019 [72]. The resulting problem is described in Appendix B. To assess the performance of our algorithm, we performed 20 runs with different initial DoE sampled by LHS. Every DoE consists of \ud835\udc5b + 1 = 12 points and we chose a budget of 5\ud835\udc5b = 55 infill points. To compare our method with a baseline, we also tested the random search method thanks to the expand_lhs new method [40] described in Section 6.1 and we also optimized the Goldstein function using EGO with a classic Kriging model based on imputation method (Imp-Kernel). This method replaces the decreed- excluded variables by their mean values: 50 or 1 respectively for (\ud835\udc653, \ud835\udc654) and (\ud835\udc671, \ud835\udc672). Fig. 8(a) plots the convergence curves for the four methods. In particular, the median is the solid line and the first and third quantiles are plotted in dotted lines. To visualize better the correspond- ing data dispersion, the boxplots of the 20 best solutions are plotted in Fig. 8(b). The results in Fig. 8 show that the hierarchical Kriging models of SMT 2.0 lead to better results than the imputation method or the random search both in terms of final objective value and variance over the 20 runs and in term of convergence rate. More precisely, SMT Arc-Kernel and SMT Alg-Kernel Kriging model gave the best EGO results and managed to converge correctly as shown in Fig. 8(b). More precisely, the 20 sampled DoEs led to similar performance and from one DoE, the method SMT Alg-Kernel managed to find the true minimum. However, this result has not been reproduced in other runs and is therefore not statistically significant. The variance between the runs is of similar magnitude regardless of the considered methods.",

The PLS information is computed by projecting the data into a smaller space spanned by the principal components. By integrating this PLS information into the Kriging correlation matrix, the number of inputs can be scaled down, thereby reducing the number of hyperparameters required. The result- ing number of hyperparameters \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52 is indeed much smaller than the original problem dimension \ud835\udc51. Recently, in SMT 2.0, we extended the KPLS method for multi-fidelity Kriging (MFKPLS and MFKPLSK) [73,79, 80]. We also proposed an automatic criterion to choose automatically the reduced dimension \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52 based on Wold\u2019s R criterion [81].

A parallel criterion called qEI [85] was developed to perform Efficient Global Optimization (EGO): the goal is to be able to run batch optimization. At each iteration of the algorithm, multiple new sampling points are extracted from the known ones. These new sampling points are then evaluated using a parallel computing environ- ment. Five criteria are implemented in SMT 2.0: Kriging Believer (KB), Kriging Believer Upper Bound (KBUB), Kriging Believer Lower Bound (KBLB), Kriging Believer Random Bound (KBRand) and Constant Liar (CLmin) [86].",
