Although the general concept of OSM does not prescribe speci\ufb01c sets of views, a concrete OSM environment has to be speci\ufb01c about the particular views to be used in a particular project. At the University of Mannheim we are developing a prototype OSM environment, nAOMi, that supports the views de\ufb01ned by the KobrA 2.0 method, a version of KobrA adapted for OSM. In this paper we provide an overview of the KobrA 2.0 metamodel underpinning nAOMi and give a small example of its use to model a software system.",

Moreover, the importance of this advantage grows quickly as the size of the system and the complexity of the deployed development methodology increase. Another important ad- vantage is that the dominance of one particular kind of view over the development process (e.g. code) at the expense of other kinds of views (e.g. graphical models) is reduced so that any appropriate type of views can be used to enrich the underlying description of the system, depending on the needs and skills of the stakeholder involved.

Abstraction is actually mapped to ExpressionInOcl. When appearing in transformations, the equals sign links elements in the SUM to the respective elements in the view, and vice versa. For instance, equal- ity of the general meta-association of a Generalization in a transformation invariant means that, when following gen- eral, there must be an element in the SUM and in the view for which similar transformation expressions are speci\ufb01ed. In the case of KobrA 2.0, which has many projections that just select a subset of elements using one-to-one abstrac- tions, this allows concise declarative TransformationExpres- sions. Together with the view constraints, a CASE tool can be implemented which uses a transformation language of the implementor\u2019s choice, for instance the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) [11] or QVT [9].
