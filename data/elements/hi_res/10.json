        "text": "ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in soft- ware engineering to perform tasks such as translating code between programming languages, generating code from natural language, and autocompleting code as it is being written. When used within development tools, these systems typically treat each model in- vocation independently from all previous invocations, and only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface. This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model\u2019s responses. We developed a prototype system \u2013 the Programmer\u2019s Assistant \u2013 in order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code, as well as software engineers\u2019 receptiveness to the idea of conversing with, rather than invoking, a code-fluent LLM. Through an evaluation with 42 partici- pants with varied levels of programming experience, we found that our system was capable of conducting extended, multi-turn discus- sions, and that it enabled additional knowledge and capabilities beyond code generation to emerge from the LLM. Despite skepti- cal initial expectations for conversational programming assistance, participants were impressed by the breadth of the assistant\u2019s capa- bilities, the quality of its responses, and its potential for improving their productivity. Our work demonstrates the unique potential of conversational interactions with LLMs for co-creative processes like software development.",

Many techniques have been developed to enhance the productivity of software engineers, such as advanced code repositories [86], knowledge repositories [39], Q&A sites [1], and pair programming practices [18]. Collaborative software engineering is especially promising, given that profes- sional software development is rarely a solo activity and relevant knowledge and expertise are typically distributed widely within an organization [68]. Many efforts have focused on incorporating col- laborative technologies into software development environments (e.g. [8, 25, 26, 58, 101]).",

The Programmer\u2019s Apprentice [70] relied on a knowledge base of \u201cclich\u00e9s,\u201d which are formal, structured versions of what are known today as software design patterns [31]. It used a hy- brid reasoning system capable of special-purpose reasoning based on frames and a plan calculus, along with general purpose logical reasoning. Although natural language interaction was envisioned, the original prototype implementation ultimately used a stylized command language.

It provides several examples of Socrates responding to gen- eral coding questions, generating code in response to a request, and accepting code as input. It establishes a convention for delimiting code in the conversation, making it easy to parse for display in the UI. It also establishes an interaction style for the assistant, directing it to be polite, eager, helpful, and humble, and to present its re- sponses in a non-authoritative manner8. Because of the possibility that the model might produce erroneous answers or incorrect code (as discussed in Weisz et al. [102]), we felt it was important that the assistant convey a sense of uncertainty to encourage users to not accept its results uncritically to avoid over-reliance (e.g. as observed in Moroz et al.\u2019s study of Copilot [51], and discussed more gener- ally in Ashktorab et al.

        "text": "3.3 Handling Model Limitations While developing the Programmer\u2019s Assistant, and in early pilot testing, we experienced some quirks and shortcomings of the model and our approach to using it for conversational interaction. One limitation stemmed from the fact that the model sometimes pro- duced incorrect responses (e.g. code with syntax errors), incomplete responses (e.g. code that was missing functionality), irrelevant re- sponses (e.g. responses not related to the user\u2019s question), or insub- stantial responses (e.g. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d). Because of the probabilistic nature of model inference, re-prompting the model would some- times produce a more correct or appropriate response. Thus, we added the ability for users to \u201ctry again,\u201d either by asking in the chat or by clicking a button in the UI (Figure 1C). This feature removes the assistant\u2019s last response from the context presented to the model and then re-invokes the model with an increased temperature10. Although it is possible for transformer models such as Codex to produce multiple possible responses to a single prompt, we only request a single response in order to speed up response time as well as to preserve the token budget for conversational context. Thus, the \u201ctry again\u201d feature provides an alternate way to produce a wider variety of responses.",

We note that prior studies (e.g. [103, 105, 109]) conducted quantitative examinations of the use of LLMs in code work; our study is akin to Weisz et al.\u2019s qualitative examination of software engineers\u2019 attitudes toward working with models that may fail to produce working code [102].

Initially, four authors performed open-coding on the open-ended survey responses. Through discussion, these codes were grouped and consolidated into a single set, which were then re-applied to the data by two authors. After another round of discussion, these authors identified a set of 12 higher-level themes. Some themes had clear parallels to quantitative survey questions or event log data, and thus represented clear instances where we were able to trian- gulate across data sources. Other themes surprised us. We structure our presentation of the results based on these 12 themes, grouped into three different aspects of the user experience: expectations and experience, utility of conversational assistance, and patterns of interaction and mental models.",

Nine NCF categories \u2013 Acknowledgment, Apology, Confirma- tion, Expression of Gratitude, Farewell, Greeting, Self-Identification, Welfare Check, and Welfare Report \u2013 appeared twice in our code- book to distinguish cases in which the utterance was made by the human participant vs. the assistant. Other NCF categories were split to provide nuanced detail about the interaction; for example, we distinguished three different kinds of NCF requests, depending upon whether they were stated as Requests for Action (e.g. \u201cWould you...\u201d), Commands of Action (e.g. \u201cWrite a function that...\u201d), or Expressions of Desire (e.g. \u201cI want...\u201d).

People told us about their frustrating experiences with conventional chatbots and raised doubts about the knowledge, capabilities, and value of a conversational programming assistant. This skepticism moti- vated us to develop the Programmer\u2019s Assistant in order to evaluate whether the conversational experience, as powered by a state-of- the-art code-fluent LLM, would be better than people had antici- pated. During pilot testing, we received feedback that the Program- mer\u2019s Assistant provided a much better conversational experience compared to testers\u2019 previous experiences with chatbots. Thus, in designing our study, we felt it important to first gauge participants\u2019 expectations of a conversational interaction around code, and then measure their experience after the fact.",

Each modality was shown to have advantages and disadvantages. For example, text-only interfaces can provide accessibility [54, 78] and productivity [53] advantages, whereas graphical user interfaces provide greater discoverability [10, 88]. Some researchers explored ways to bridge the two interaction modes, such as by developing GUI wrappers for command line programs [53, 94] or by developing tools that converted GUI activities into procedural descriptions [55]. Our view is that similar bridges can be constructed between direct manipulation, search, and conversational models of interaction; a user\u2019s interaction with an LLM need not be constrained to a single interaction model.",

Clearly, the Program- mer\u2019s Assistant was viewed by our participants as a useful tool that provided real value \u2013 so much so that many participants explic- itly requested or expressed the desire to use it in their own work. However, how much of this value was derived from the model itself and its ability to produce high-quality responses to programming questions, versus from participants\u2019 ability to conduct extended conversational interactions grounded in their actual source code? We believe that both of these constituent aspects were valuable. Indeed, many participants commented on their surprise and satis- faction with the quality of the assistant\u2019s responses (Section 5.2.3). However, participants also valued the conversational interactions that they had with the assistant. In the event logs, we saw evi- dence that participants were leveraging conversational context to ask follow-up questions as well as leveraging code context by ask- ing about their code selections (Section 5.3.2). Many participants reported that they would find the tool less valuable if the conver- sational interaction were removed (Section 5.3.2).

However, direct manipulation interfaces may be less ideal for surfacing the emergent behaviors of a foundation model [14], and thus natural language interaction may be more suit- able.

We assert that the learning should operate in both directions: not only should people improve their programming skills, but the model itself can also improve based on peoples\u2019 interactions with it. For example, when the assistant provides a code example to the user, and the user takes that example and edits it, those edits constitute feedback that can be used to further fine-tune the model. In addition, through longitudinal use, we believe that human and AI partners can create reciprocal representations of one another \u2013 i.e., the human is likely to create a mental model of the AI, and the AI may be engineered to develop a user model for each of its human users [30, 48, 79]. Such a pair of models is often described as Mutual Theory of Mind [29, 100]. This type of capability raises the possibility of personalizing and adapting an assistant to the strengths and needs of individual users. With such models, an assistant that knows a user is learning a programming language could provide natural language explana- tions alongside code outputs, whereas an assistant that knows a user is strongly skilled in a programming language might shorten or omit those explanations. Similarly, users are likely to update their mental models of the AI with more experience.

We further used the prompting mechanism of the model to set up a conversational interaction in which the model uses the conversational history, plus the user\u2019s current utterance, in order to generate a response. In this way, users are able to ask follow-up questions in the chat that reference prior utterances and responses.
