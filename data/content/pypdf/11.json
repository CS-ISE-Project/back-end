INTRODUCTION  \n    The non-renewable energy sources are rapidly running out, \nwhile the electricity demand  is increasing daily. To solve this \nproblem, efficient and efficient electric power generation from \nrenewable energy sources is required [1]. Renewable energy is \none of the forms of energy that society can rely on because It \nis unpolluted, pure , and has no limits. One type of power \ngeneration that uses renewable energy is the photovoltaic (PV) \nsystem [2]. To utilize less conventional energy, the PV system \nmust subsequently be linked to the grid, either directly or via a \nbackup battery bank. Since the power produced by PV \nsystems depends on radiation and temperature change, the PV \nframework has destitute productivity,  [2]. \n   For the control of the PV systems, there are different sorts of \nDC-DC converters such as Buck converters, Boost converters, \nand Buck -Boost converters. Due to its output pick-up \nadaptability, a single -ended primary -inductor convert er \n(SEPIC) acts as a buck -boost DC/DC converter, where it \nchanges its output voltage agreeing to its duty cycle. Unlike the \ncustomary buck -boost converter, the SEPIC converter includes \na non -inverted output and it uses an arrangement capacitor to \nseparate i nput from output [3]. The buck and buck -boost \nconverters lose half of their input control due to input current arrangement exchange ; for that reason, the two types of \nconverters should be excluded from maximum power \napplications. The boost converter has a nonstop input current, \nbut the output voltage is always bigger than the input, which \nmay not accomplish maximum power exchange operation in a \nfew cases, such as when the m aximum voltage is less than the \ninput [3].  \n    This paper presents a fuzzy -based P&O st rategy for an MPPT \nstandalone PV system. The proposed MPPT can abuse  the \npreferences of the P&O strategy and eliminate  its drawbacks. \nOutput has been sep arated into five fuzzy subsets. As the \nproposed strategy continuously exchanges maximum power \nfrom PV arrays, it optimizes the number of PV modules.  \nII. MODELIG N OF PV SYSTEM   \n    Photovoltaic is the technique and study connected to devices \nthat directly convert sunlight into electricit y utilizing \nphotovoltaic semiconductors. Direct conversion of solar energy \ninto DC electrical energy can be achieved by photovoltaic cells \n[4]. The photovoltaic panel is made up of numerous cells that \nare connected in series Ns or shunt Nsh. Where it may b e \nmimicked by a current source coupled in parallel with a diode \nas described b y and depicted in Figure 1 [5]. \n \nFig. 1.  Circuit for a  PV array.  \n \n",

Therefore , it is \ncommon for the shunt and series resistances of a solar cell can \nbe neglected to simplify the model. The resulting ideal voltage -\ncurrent  characteristic of the solar cell is given by equation (3).  \nI= Iph\u2212 I0[e(qV\nKT)\u22121]                                                        (3)  \nIII. SEPIC  CONVERTER  \nPower electronics researchers are working hard to create DC -\nDC converters with simpler designs and greater efficiency [7]. \nTo maintain a constant output voltage, the suggested DC -to-DC \nconverter employs a single -ended primary -induc tor converter \n(SEPIC) architecture. The SEPIC converter is made up of a duty \ncycle switch S, a diode, two inductors (L1 and L2), two \ncapacitors (C1 and C2), and a load resistor. Figure 2 depicts the \ncircuit diagram of a SEPIC converter.  A SEPIC is a DC -DC \nconverter [8]. SEPIC  are DC -DC converters that can output \nvoltages that are B, larger than, or equal to the input voltage. \nThe duty cycle of the control transistor affects the SEPIC \nconverter's output voltage. The SEPIC converter is two \nconverte rs in one: a boost converter followed by a buck -boost \nconverter . It has the advantages of having a non -inverted output \n(the output voltage has the same polarity as the input voltage)  , \nusing a series capacitor to couple energy from the input to the \noutput (which makes it more responsive to short -circuits), and \nbeing able t o shut down completely: when the switch \"S\" is \nturned off, the output voltage drops to 0 V, accompanied by a \nsignificant transient discharge of charge.  \n \n \nFig. 2.  Simple circuit diagram of the SEPIC converter  \n \nFigure 3 depicts the circuit when the power switch is switched \non and off (in Figures a and b, respectively).  Figure 3a When the swit ch is on, the first inductor, L1  is charged from the input \nvoltage source. The second inductor L 2 absorbs energy from  \nthe first capacitor C 1, leaving the output capacitor C 2 to supply \nthe load current.  \n \nFig. 3.a. The switch turned on . \n \n \nFig. 3.b. The switch  turned off.  \nFig. 3. Equivalent circuit diagram of the SEPIC  conver ter \nwhen the switch is on and off . \n \n  When the switch is turned on, the input inductor is charged \nfrom the source, and the second inductor is charged from the \nfirst capacitor. No energy is supplied to the lo ad capacitor \nduring this time. The i nductor current and capacitor voltage  \npolarities are marked in this Figure. When the power switch is \nturned off, the energy stored in the inductor is transferred.  The \nenergy stored is transferred  through the diode and suppl ies the \nenergy to the load [ 10], as shown in Figure 3 . b. The second \ninductor is also connected to the load during this time. The \noutput capacitor sees a pulse of current during the off time, \nmaking it inherently noisier than a buck converter. The amount \nthat the SEPIC converters increase or decrease the voltage \ndepends prim arily on the duty cycle and the parasitic elements \nin the circuit. The output of an ideal SEPIC converter is:  \nVout= D\n1\u2212D Vin                                                                       (4) \n \n   A SEPIC converter is to process the electricity from the PV \nsystem. This converter either increases or decreases the PV \nsystem voltage at the load. The proposed SEPIC converter \noperates in buck mode.  \nIV. FUZZY  LOGIC  CONTROL  \n     In the fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) \nalgorithm, the voltage and current at each instant k are \nmeasured to calculate the active power. The active power is \nthen compared with the power at the previous instant (k -1) to \nobtain the change in p ower (\u0394P(k)). Similarly, the voltage at \ninstant k is compared with the voltage at instant k -1 to obtain \n",
    " \nthe voltage error (\u0394V(k))  [11]. The power error is then divided \nby the current error to obtain the error (E). The error is then \ncompared with the previo us error to calculate the change in \nerror (\u0394E(k)). The error (E(k)) and the change in error (\u0394E(k)) \nare then used as the crisp inputs to the fuzzy logic controller. \nThe flow chart for the fuzzy logic MPPT algorithm is shown in \nFigure 4. In this work, the M amdani inference technique, A -\ntype membership functions, and a 25 -element rule base were \nused for the fuzzy logic control. The Mamdani inference \ntechnique is efficient and straightforward in defining the fuzzy \noutput sets, and it is more popular among rese archers than other \ninference techniques [12]. The A -type or triangular \nmembership function is used because it is simpler to split into \nlow and high membership functions (MFs) than other \nmembership functions. Additionally, it has been observed that \nthe tria ngular membership function has a faster response and \nless overshoot than other functions [13]. A 25 -element rule base \nwas used because it  has been shown to perform well [14][15].  \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4.
