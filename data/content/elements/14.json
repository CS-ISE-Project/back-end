    "The Stochastic Subset Optimization (SSO) algorithm was proposed for optimal reliability problems that mini- mizes the probability of system failure over the admissible space for the design parameters. It is based on the simulation of samples of the design parameters from an auxiliary Probability Density Function (PDF) and exploiting the information contained in these samples to identify subregions for the optimal design parameters within the original design space. This paper presents an improved version of SSO, named iSSO to overcome the shortcomings in the SSO. In the improved version, the Voronoi tessellation is implemented to partition the design space into non-overlapping subregions using the pool of samples distributed according to the auxiliary PDF. A double-sort approach is then used to identify the subregions for the optimal design. The iSSO is presented as a generalized design optimization approach primarily tailored for the stochastic structural systems but also adaptable to deterministic systems. Several optimization problems are considered to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iSSO.",
    "approaches available in the literature, however, but it\u2019s worth noting that no one-size-fits-all optimization approach is ideal for all sorts of problems [4\u20137]. The choice of optimization method is often determined by the specific characteristics of the problem, such as its complexity, dimensionality, constraints, and the nature of the objective function. As a result, there is always a scope for new approaches to be developed or the adaptation of existing methods to better suit specific problem clas- ses. A detailed discussion of deterministic optimization approaches can be found in the literature [8,9].",
    "1. Introduction",
    "Structural optimization may be defined as the rational establishment of an economical structural design with the available resources while satisfying specific performance criteria. In general terms, the economy may be characterized by minimum weight, minimum cost, maximum utility, or even minimum probability of failure. Broadly, structural optimization can be categorized into deterministic and stochastic opti- mization [1,2]. The classical statement of unconstraint deterministic optimization is mathematically expressed as:",
    "In any practical situation, several parameters, such as loadings, structural parameters, geometric parameters, operation conditions, etc., are either not known at the design stage or are subjected to random fluctuations that give rise to performance variability and affect the performance of a system [10]. These parameters are characterized as uncertain parameters. Deterministic structural optimization discards the impact of uncertainty and can result in improper design. Therefore, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in the parameters during opti- mization by using the rational methods of probabilistic structural analysis [11]. Such structural optimization that accounts for un- certainties is called stochastic optimization [12]. Although stochastic optimization refers to any method that employs randomness within some communities, in this paper, we will only consider settings where",

In the deterministic structural optimization problem, the uncertainties in parameters are ignored, and fixed values are assumed for all the parameters. There are numerous optimizations",

    "the objective function is random. Stochastic optimization or optimal design under uncertainty has been widely applied in many practical engineering fields, including civil engineering structures [13\u201315], composite structures [16,17], and vehicles [18,19].",
    "various challenging optimization problems, it has two shortcomings. First, the effectiveness of SSO is dependent on the correct selection of the geometrical shape of the admissible subsets. Here, it is pertinent to mention that choosing a geometrical shape that effectively investigates the sensitivity of the objective function to each design variable is essential. The shapes, such as hyper-rectangle and hyper-ellipse are suggested in the literature for the admissible subsets. However, as shown later via the illustrative example, these shapes fail to include the optimal solution in cases with complex design spaces or problems with multiple optimal solutions. And second, identifying the optimal subset that con- tains the smallest volume density involves a non-smooth optimization problem which is quite challenging.",
    "Consider an engineering system that involves deterministic design parameters \u03c6, and uncertain variables \u03b8 = [\u03b81\u22ef\u03b8n\u03b8 ]T \u2208 \u0398\u2282Rn\u03b8 following a joint PDF p(\u03b8|\u03c6), where \u0398 denotes the parameter space of the uncer- tain variables. The classical statement of stochastic optimization is mathematically expressed as:",

    "where, h(\u03c6, \u03b8) : Rn\u03b8 +n\u03c6 \u2192R is the structural performance function, and E\u03b8[ \u22c5 ] denotes expectation with respect to the PDF for \u03b8. Note that the objective function in the optimization problem in (2) is the expectation E\u03b8[h(\u03c6, \u03b8)] which is a deterministic function. It\u2019s worth mentioning that stochastic optimization may also involve other stochastic measures such as variance or quantile values. However, these stochastic measures can rarely be evaluated analytically; therefore, several methods have been proposed for solving stochastic optimization problems. These special- ized methods include, for example, sample average approximation, stochastic approximation, stochastic subset optimization, and ap- proaches based on the use of Taylor series expansion [15,20,21], response surface, and metamodels [22\u201325]. Specific to structural engi- neering, there are two broad categories of problems involving design optimization under uncertainty [26\u201335]: Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) and Robust Design Optimization (RDO). The objective of RBDO is to find an optimal solution that minimizes some deterministic, objective function under observance of probabilistic constraints instead of conventional deterministic constraints [36,37]. On the other hand, RDO aims to find an optimal solution that is insen- sitive (or less sensitive) to input variations. It improves the design quality by minimizing performance variation without eliminating un- certainty [29,38].",
    "In this paper, an improved version of SSO is developed to overcome the shortcomings of the original SSO. This new version of the algorithm, as mentioned earlier, is named iSSO (improved SSO). Voronoi tessella- tion is implemented to partition the design space into non-overlapping subregions (a set of Voronoi cells) using the pool of samples distrib- uted according to the auxiliary PDF. The admissible set (a set of all admissible subregions) is then defined as a set containing all subsets of the set of Voronoi cells. This approach is able to capture the regions with lower objective function values even if they are disjointed or when the design space is complex. The details of the Voronoi tessellation are presented in Appendix A. A double-sort algorithm is then implemented to identify the optimal subset containing the smallest volume density.",
    "In the next section, the original SSO is reviewed. Section 3 presents the general theoretical and computational framework for the iSSO al- gorithm. Section 4 considers several optimization problems to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iSSO algorithm.",
    "2. Original stochastic subset optimization",
    "In SSO, say at the i + 1th iteration, the design space is represented by a subset I(i), where I(i) \u2208 I(i (cid:0) 1)\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u2208 I(0) \u2208 \u03a6. Following the augmented formulation concept initially discussed in [44] for RBDO, the design parameters \u03c6, are artificially considered uncertain variables with a prescribed PDF p(\u03c6|I(i)) over the design space I(i) [45]. For convenience, p(\u03c6|I(i)) = 1/V(i) is considered, where V(i) is the volume of I(i). In this setting of the augmented stochastic design problem, the auxiliary PDF is defined as:",
    "Taflanidis and Beck [39] introduced a novel algorithm for optimal reliability problem, the so-called SSO. SSO involves formulating an augmented problem where the design parameters are artificially considered uncertain and defining an auxiliary PDF that includes the structural performance function and the PDF of the uncertain variables. Next, SSO involves generating a pool of samples distributed according to this auxiliary PDF and identifying a subregion in the original design space, which, on average, improves the value of the objective function. By repeating this procedure several times, it is possible to determine at each step a smaller subregion in the design space, which in turn im- proves the value of the objective function. Ultimately, this subregion will be sufficiently small to directly identify the optimal solution or provide sufficient information to launch another optimization algo- rithm, such as the sample average approximation or stochastic approx- imation. The implementation of the SSO method closely resembles the Subset Simulation (SS) algorithm [40] for reliability analysis. Since SSO is based on simulation, it can deal with linear or nonlinear problems and, at least theoretically, an unbounded number of design parameters. The numerical effort for solving a given optimization problem is indepen- dent of the number of uncertain variables, and it grows linearly with the number of design parameters.",

An extension of SSO termed Non-Parametric SSO, which adopts kernel density estimation to approximate the objective function, is presented in [41].

In [3], an augmented formulation is presented for the RDO of structures using SSO. SSO or its variants have also been applied to solve structural optimization problems. SSO has been used for reliability optimization and sensitivity analysis in system design in [39]. A framework for RDO of Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD) by SSO is dis- cussed in [43].

In the SSO framework, such approximation of \u03c0(\u03c6|I(i)) is avoided. In SSO, samples distributed as \u03c0(\u03c6|I(i)) are obtained, and the information in these samples is exploited to identify a smaller subset of the design space with a high likelihood of containing the optimal design parameters. Samples distributed as \u03c0(\u03c6, \u03b8|I(i)) are obtained using any appropriate stochastic sampling algorithm, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [46].

A candidate sample [\u03c6c,\u03b8c] is simulated using the proposal q(\u03c6c,\u03b8c|\u03c6,\u03b8) and is accepted with the probability min(1, a0), where, a0 is given as:",
    "3.5. Implementation issues",
    "An important issue for the effective implementation of the iSSO is the creation of the Voronoi cells at the current iteration bounded within the Voronoi cell created at the previous iterations. Although it is possible to create such bounded Voronoi cells, due to the geometrical complexities, it is usually unfeasible for the higher dimensional problems (n\u03c6>2). An alternative approach is proposed in the present study for creating the Voronoi cells at any iteration of the iSSO. The proposed approach in- volves creating Voronoi cells using the samples generated at the current and all previous iterations and then by considering Voronoi cells cor- responding to the samples from the current iteration. This is shown in Fig. 3, where Fig. 3(a) shows the N samples at the first iteration and the corresponding Voronoi cells. Fig. 3(b) shows the \u03c1N selected Voronoi cells leading to the smallest volume density and the additional (1 (cid:0) \u03c1)N samples being generated using these \u03c1N samples as seeds. Fig. 3(c) shows that the Voronoi cells are generated using all N + (1 (cid:0) \u03c1)N samples that are generated in the two iterations. The Voronoi cells corresponding to the N samples for consideration at the second iteration are also highlighted in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) shows a zoomed-in version of Fig. 3(c) where it can be observed that the area covered by the N Voronoi cells considered in the second iteration is not the same as the area covered by the \u03c1N Voronoi cells selected in the first iteration. On the contrary, the area covered by the Voronoi cells in the second iteration is more than the area covered by the Voronoi cells corresponding to the seed samples from the first iteration. This is because a new sample within the Voronoi cell between an existing sample and the existing Voronoi cell edge results in the relocation of the Voronoi cell edge in a",

It is also seen that both SSO and iSSO result in a similar value of volume reduction for the same stopping criterion; however, with SSO, the number of iterations required to achieve this volume reduction are relatively higher.

    "This study attempts to provide an optimization approach called \"iSSO\", which is an improved version of SSO, primarily for stochastic optimization problems while it retains utility for deterministic optimi- zation problems as well. Two novel ideas are introduced in this study: first, a better characterization of the design space is offered by parti- tioning the design space into non-overlapping subregions using Voronoi",

    "tessellation which improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the pro- posed iSSO considerably in comparison to SSO. Second, a novel \"double sort\" approach is proposed, eliminating the need for optimization to identify the subregions for the optimal design at each iSSO iteration. Several mathematical and engineering design examples, including TMD, 120 bars truss structure, and base-isolated structure, are included in this study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed iSSO. The results show that the proposed iSSO effectively identifies the reduced design space for complex design problems with multiple global and local minima. This is attributable to the Voronoi tessellation, which eliminates the require- ment of the presumed admissible design space form to resemble the contour of the original design. Voronoi tessellation enabled better design space exploration, allowing multiple global minima scattered throughout the design pace to be effectively identified. Due to the dis- cretization of the design space via Voronoi tessellation, computation demand is significantly reduced as the number of function evaluations for all examples is lower vis-a-vis the original SSO. Moreover, the novel idea of the double sort approach achieves the requisite precision in identifying the subregions for optimal solutions and makes iSSO implementation simple and effective.",

    "Voronoi tessellation is a mathematical concept named after the Russian mathematician Georgy Voronoi. It is also known as the Voronoi diagram or Dirichlet tessellation. A Voronoi tessellation of a set of points P in a plane is a partition of the plane into a set of non-overlapping convex polygons, with each polygon including precisely one point of P and each point in a polygon being closer to its associated point in P than to any other point in P. Each polygon is referred to as a Voronoi cell or a Dirichlet region. The boundary of each cell is constituted of points that are equidistant to two or more points in P. Fig. 12 shows the Voronoi diagram in a two-dimensional design space.",
    "Fig. 12. Voronoi diagram in 2-dimensional space.",
    "There are several efficient algorithms for creating Voronoi diagrams. One such basic algorithm is to start with a set of points and then compute the Voronoi cells by dividing the space into regions based on the distance to the nearest point. The Bowyer-Watson algorithm [51], which generates a Delaunay triangulation in any number of dimensions, can be applied while creating a Voronoi diagram. The Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation of the point in which no point falls within the circumcircle of any triangle. The polygon generated by the intersection of the half-planes defined by the edges of the Delaunay triangles enclosing the point is therefore obtained as the Voronoi cell of a point.",
    "It can be summarized that Voronoi tessellation is a powerful mathematical concept that aids in dividing space into regions based on the distance to a set of points. Voronoi tessellation finds widespread applications in areas such as image processing [52], spatial topology analysis [53], and microstructure study [52]. The MATLAB command \"Voronoin\" from the \"Parallel Computing Toolbox\" [54] has been used in this study to create the Voronoi cells.",
