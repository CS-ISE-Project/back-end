INTRODUCTION\nThe 4th Industrial Revolution has had a dramatic impact\non the engineering profession. The modern technologies such\nas arti\ufb01cial intelligence, the internet of things, and advanced\nrobotics have altered engineering systems and processes. To-\nday\u2019s engineers are expected to be able to leverage these\nresources to produce their products. To meet the new profes-\nsional requirements, engineering educational institutions have\nrevised their curricula. The changes in the curricula include\nboth updating the existing programs as well as introduc-\ning completely new programs. Given the rapid technological\nprogress, universities and colleges around the world are con-\ntinuously adapting to the ever-changing environment. While a\nsigni\ufb01cant progress in modernizing the engineering curriculum\nhas been achieved, there still remains room for improvement.\nCatalyzed by the exponential increase in computational\npower and interconnectedness, the modern industrial revolu-\ntion has reshaped the skills and competencies required of the\nengineers. The changes in engineering curricula in response to\nIndustry 4.0 have been threefold: i) modernizing the existing\nprograms, ii) introduction of new programs, and iii) revising\nthe pedagogical approach. Modernizing the existing programs\ninvolves introduction of new courses in the study plan related\nto emerging technologies. In addition, existing courses can be\nupdated with new content.

Finally,\nuniversities have revised their approaches to course delivery.\nStudent-centered learning, project-based learning, and applied\nlearning have become popular in the new engineering educa-\ntional paradigm.\nWhile signi\ufb01cant effort has been made to revise the core\nengineering courses, the auxiliary courses in mathematics and\nsciences received little consideration. The mathematics and\nsciences courses play a key role in the engineering curriculum.\nGiven their importance, the curriculum updates must also be\nextended to the auxiliary courses. By implementing a com-\nprehensive update of the engineering curriculum that includes\nboth the core and auxiliary courses, a more effective outcome\ncan be achieved.\nThe goal of this paper is to propose a modernized engineer-\ning mathematics curriculum in line with the broader efforts to\nupdate engineering education to adapt to Industry 4.0. The key\nfeature of the new curriculum is the introduction numerical\ncomputing in the existing mathematics courses. The latest\nindustrial revolution has been driven largely by the dramatic\nincrease in computational power. Therefore, today\u2019s engineers\nmust be well-equipped to leverage the computing power in\ntheir work.\nSince mathematics courses are usually taken at the begin-\nning of the study plan, it offers a natural avenue for introducing\nnumerical computing to students. Furthermore, many problems\nin mathematics can be solved numerically making it natural\nto integrate numerical computing in mathematics courses.\nBy studying numerical computing in mathematics courses,\nstudents will acquire the necessary theoretical and practical\nskills to apply in their downstream, specialized engineering\ncourses.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an\noverview of the existing efforts to update the engineering\ncurriculum in response to Industry 4.0. Section 3 discusses\nthe current approaches to integrate scienti\ufb01c computing in\nmathematics courses. In Section 4, we present our proposal\nfor modernizing the mathematics curriculum to integrate nu-\nmerical computing. Section 5 concludes the paper with \ufb01nal\nremarks.\n",
    "II. ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY 4.0\nEngineering departments in colleges and universities have\nmade signi\ufb01cant changes in their curricula in response to\nthe new environment created by the recent, rapid advances\nin technology. In particular, the existing programs have been\nupdated to include courses that target emerging technologies.\nCompletely new programs related to AI and mechatronics\nhave also been adopted by universities. Innovations in the\n\ufb01eld of engineering education continue to take place with new\ndevelopments on the horizon.\nThere exist several studies investigating the modern en-\ngineering curricula and evaluating their effectiveness. It is\nargued in [6] that engineering educators must prepare their\nstudents to face three key challenges: sustainability, the 4th\nIndustrial Revolution, and employability. The authors \ufb01nd that\ncolleges and universities are responding to these challenges by\nemphasizing student-centered learning, integration of theory\nand practice, digital and online learning, and the de\ufb01nition of\nprofessional competencies. In particular, response to the needs\nof Industry 4.0 require interdisciplinary collaboration across\nseveral programs and disciplines. Interaction and integration\nof technologies plays a key role in this process [10], [12]. In-\nterdisciplinary engineering education requires sound pedagogy\nand teaming experiences to encourage student in collaborative\nand interdisciplinary practice [23].\nDigital and online learning have become an important part\nof modern education including in the \ufb01eld of engineering.\nInformation technologies play a vital role in delivering digital\nlearning to students. Colleges and universities have made\nsigni\ufb01cant investments to improve their information and com-\nmunication technology (ICT) capacities [7].\nIn response to the needs of Industry 4.0, some univer-\nsities have adopted the framework of Education 4.0 [15],\n[19]. The new education framework consists of four main\ncomponents: i) competencies, ii) learning methods, iii) ICT,\nand iv) infrastructure. Students competencies are based on\ntechnological knowledge and skills for successful workplace\nperformance, while the learning methods are based on problem\nsolving and challenge-based learning. In particular, active and\nproject-based learning plays an important role in Education\n4.0 [4], [8]. Other innovative approaches to learning such as\nvirtual-reality based engineering education can help improve\nthe learning process related to Industry 4.0 [20].\nIn addition to technological progress, socio-cultural shifts\nmust be taken into account in revising engineering curriculum.\nThe new generation of students has its unique worldview\nwhich needs to be considered by the educators. In particular,\nthe new generation is signi\ufb01cantly affected by mobile devices\nand digital media. Educational content must be tailored to\nthe new student preferences to achieve effective learning\noutcomes [16]. Innovative approaches such gami\ufb01cation may\nhelp improve the learning process [13], [17].\nMany universities have also introduced nontechnical updates\nto their engineering curriculum. The most signi\ufb01cant nontech-\nnical update has been the introduction of entrepreneurship\ncourses and experiences for students. A lot of attention has\nrecently been given to equipping students with entrepreneurial\nskills. Students learn about entrepreneurship in their courses\nas well as through university incubators.\nIII. UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM\nThe mathematics curriculum changed very little in the\ncurrent century. It remains a largely analytic domain, where so-\nlutions are mainly obtained manually. The current mathematics\ncurriculum emphasizes theory over practical approaches. For\ninstance, when \ufb01nding the extreme values of a function,\nderivative-based approach is preferred over the gradient de-\ncent. There are two key reasons for why analytical approaches\nare favored over numerical methods. First, analytical solutions\nare reliable and elegant. An analytical solution is guaranteed\nto be exact. Second, mathematics courses are usually taught\nby pure mathematicians who have an inherent preference\nfor analytical solutions. Pure mathematics which is based on\ntheorem proving is not amenable to numerical methods.\nDespite the popularity of analytical approaches to problem\nsolving in mathematics, there has been a growing push to inte-\ngrate computer algebra systems as part of the learning process.\nComputer algebra systems such as Matlab and Mathematica\nare now routinely used in many mathematics courses. The\nstudy by Cretchley et al. [5] found that engineering students\nwere positive about the use of technology as a learning tool\nin mathematics courses. The increased use of technology in\nclass helped improve student focus and interest in lectures.\nStudent evaluations also indicated that they had a greater level\nof enjoyment towards the lectures due to the use of technology.\nIt is noteworthy that students chose not to rely too heavily on\ntechnology during the examinations despite the freedom to do\nso. The students found it extremely important to be competent\nwith analytical mathematical skills as opposed to purely com-\nputational skills. Some revealed that they learn the subjects\nequally well without the help of scienti\ufb01c packages, although\nthe perception towards the use of computer is in general highly\npositive. Almost all students responded positively to Matlab\nas an effective tool for computation and graphing. Many\nused Matlab for non-examination purposes. For example, they\nutilized it to check their handwritten mathematical steps in\nassignments and practice problems; and others used it for\nexploration beyond the standard syllabus and curriculum.\nThe in\ufb02uence of computer technology on students\u2019 aca-\ndemic performance and learning experience has been inves-\ntigated by several authors. Abdul Majid et al. [1], [2] used\nMatlab as an aid to teach calculus to engineering students.\nThe software package was used for various course learning\noutcomes such as graphical display of mathematical functions,\nexploration, identifying and predicting structural patterns in\nevaluating a series of complex inde\ufb01nite integrals, and numeri-\ncal approximations in applied mathematics. The study showed\na positive impact on students\u2019 academic performance in the\n\ufb01nal examinations. The study concluded that the integration\nof scienti\ufb01c packages into engineering mathematics courses\ncould be effective under certain conditions. Similarly, other\n",
    "studies [18], [21] also found a positive impact from the use\nof scienti\ufb01c software packages on students\u2019 motivation in\nlearning mathematics.\nIn a separate study by Brake [3], the authors investigated the\nuse of Matlab in engineering mathematics courses to increase\nstudent con\ufb01dence level and mathematical abilities. Matlab\nwas used to solve concrete engineering problems which require\na deep understanding of underlying mathematical principles.\nThe study found generally positive student response to the\nuse of software in their mathematics courses. However, the\nresults of the study must be considered carefully given the\nsmall sample size of the subjects.\nAlthough the majority of the studies were based on the\nuse of Matlab, several other studies considered alternative\nmathematics software packages. The study by Kilicman et al.\n[11] focused on the use of Maple to help students understand\nboth the theoretical and computational aspects of linear algebra\nfor engineering students. In particular, it was shown that the\nuse of Maple facilitates the understanding of computational as-\npects of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It allows students more\ntime to focus on the theoretical aspects and the underlying\nmathematical principles.\nIn a recent study by Mezhennaya and Pugachev [14], the\nauthors compared engineering students\u2019 perceptions regarding\nseveral mathematical software: Matlab, Mathematica and Ex-\ncel. The study found that all the scienti\ufb01c packages considered\ncan be used in education, under the condition that the policies\nfor software usage are carefully implemented. The study\nfound that many students lack hands-on experience on how\nto use the software. The students particularly struggled with\nMatlab and Mathematica \ufb01nding them non user friendly. The\nstudy concluded that additional classes are required to prepare\nstudents to use software in their courses.\nIV. NUMERICAL COMPUTING IN MATHEMATICS\nCURRICULUM\nMathematics lies at the foundation of science and engineer-\ning. The importance of mathematics courses in engineering\neducation cannot be underestimated. These courses equip stu-\ndents with the fundamental skills and knowledge to study the\nmore specialized engineering courses. Thus, student success in\nengineering studies depends directly on the mathematics and\nsciences courses. Given the signi\ufb01cance of the mathematics\ncourses in the engineering curriculum, it is paramount to\nensure their currency with respect to the Industry 4.0.\nThe technological advances over the last decade have\ncreated demand for more computationally pro\ufb01cient experts.\nTo meet this demand, numerical computing must become a\ncore part of engineering studies. Mathematics courses offer\na natural and convenient avenue for introducing numerical\ncomputing to engineering students. There are two main fac-\ntors that make mathematics courses particularly amenable\nto numerical computing. First, in many cases mathematical\nproblems have numerical solutions. For instance, \ufb01nding the\nroot of a polynomial or the minimum value of a function\ncan be done numerically. Therefore, it is both logical and\nappropriate to apply numerical computing to mathematical\nproblems. Second, mathematics courses are usually taken\nat the beginning of the study plan. Thus, students become\nacquainted with numerical computing at an early stage. The\ncomputing and programming skills acquired in this manner\nwill have a positive effect in the more advanced, downstream\nengineering courses.\nThe key idea for the proposed curriculum update is the\naddition of computing tutorials (labs) to mathematics courses.\nIn particular, we propose adding weekly computing tutorials\n(labs) related to the main lecture material. For instance, in the\nweek in which students cover \ufb01nding the extreme values of a\nfunction, there will be a computing tutorial where students\nlearn and implement the gradient descent algorithm. The\nsuggested length of each tutorial is 1 hour. It is enough\ntime to implement most of the numerical algorithms at the\nundergraduate level. At the same time, 1 extra hour per week\nwill not overburden the students.\nThe exact details of numerical computing content is left\nfor individual universities and instructors. Depending on the\nsyllabus and course learning outcomes, the numerical com-\nputing labs will be different for each university and instructor.\nNevertheless, the general ideas will be broadly similar across\ndifferent curricula. To illustrate the proposed numerical com-\nputing content, we will focus on the three main concept in\ncalculus: limits, derivatives, and integrals.\nA. Limits\nLimit is a fundamental concept in calculus. Students are\nusually taught to calculate limits using analytical approaches.\nAlthough analytical approaches work well, there is no single\nuniversal rule for calculating limits. On the other hand, in most\ncases, limits can be calculated numerically using essentially\nthe same approach. To illustrate, suppose we want to calculate\nlimx\u2192a+ f(x). Then we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate\nf(a+10\u2212k). As k increases, a+10\u2212k approaches a, so f(a+\n10\u2212k) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. We can\ndeduce the limit by observing the values of f(a + 10\u2212k) or\ndetermine that the limit does not exist if there is no pattern of\nconvergence. The value of n can be chosen manually or using\na stopping criterion. For instance, the algorithm may continue\nto iterate until the difference between consecutive values of\nf(a + 10\u2212k) is below a certain threshold. The value of the\nlimit can also be deduced automatically based on the values\nof f(a + 10\u2212k) using various heuristics.\nAnother common limit problem is limx\u2192\u221e f(x). In this\ncase, we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f(10k). As k\nincreases, 10k approaches \u221e, so f(10k) will, in most cases,\napproach the limit value. Then the limit can be determined\nbased on the values of f(10k). Various extensions and cus-\ntomizations of this basic approach can be made. For instance,\nto avoid issues with periodic functions f(10k + \u01ebk), where \u01ebk\nare randomly generated, can be used. Other values than 10k\ncan also be used as long as the sequence approaches in\ufb01nity.\nA degree of automization can be introduced using different\nheuristics.\n",
    "B. Derivative\nDerivative is arguably the most important concept in cal-\nculus. There exist several rules such as the power rule, the\nproduct rule, the chain rule, and others to \ufb01nd the derivative\nof a function by hand. However, manual differentiation may\nbe cumbersome when dealing with complex function. On the\nother hand, calculating the derivative at a point numerically is\nrelatively straightforward. To illustrate, suppose that we want\nto calculate f \u2032(a). Recall that\nf \u2032(a) = lim\nx\u2192a\nf(a + h) \u2212 f(a)\nh\n.\n(1)\nTherefore, to calculate f \u2032(a) numerically we use the same\napproach as with the limits. In particular, we can loop for k =\n0 to n and calculate f(a+10\u2212k)\u2212f(a)\n10\u2212k\n. Then the limit, and by\nextension the derivative, can be deduced (approximated) based\non the calculated values. The accuracy of the approximation\ndepends in large part on the value of n.\nOne of the most important applications of the derivative is\n\ufb01nding the extreme values of a function. Traditionally, this is\ndone by \ufb01rst \ufb01nding the critical points of the function and\nthen applying the second derivative test. However, \ufb01nding the\ncritical points is not always possible, so numerical approaches\ncan be used in such cases. The most popular numerical\napproach for \ufb01nding the extreme values is based on the\ngradient descent (ascent) algorithm. In gradient descent, the\noptimal value of x is iteratively updated based on the gradient.\nIn particular, for k = 0 to n, the updated optimal value of x\nis given by\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b1\u2207f(xk),\n(2)\nwhere \u2207f(x) is the gradient and \u03b1 is the step size. In the\ncase of a single-variable function, the gradient equals simply\nto the derivative \u2207f(x) = f \u2032(x). The step size \u03b1 can be\neither \ufb01xed or dynamic. While a large value of \u03b1 accelerates\nthe convergence at the beginning, it may hurt the convergence\nin the region near the optimal value.\nThere exist several extensions of the basic gradient descent\nalgorithm. One such extension is gradient descent with mo-\nmentum which uses the second derivative to anticipate the\nlocation of the next optimal point and thus accelerates the\nconvergence.\nC. Integrals\nIntegration is an important concept in engineering mathe-\nmatics. Although there exist a number of rules for \ufb01nding the\nintegral, it is signi\ufb01cantly more challenging than differentia-\ntion. Moreover, in many cases, the inde\ufb01nite integral does not\neven exist. Therefore, numerical approaches are particularly\nuseful for integration.\nTo illustrate the application of numerical integration, sup-\npose that we want to calculate\n\ufffd b\na f(x) dx. There exist several\nnumerical methods for calculating the integral. One simple\nmethod is based on the Riemann sums. The interval [a, b] is\ndivided into n equal subintervals with endpoints x0, x1, ..., xn.\nLet \u03b4 = xk+1 \u2212xk be the length of each subinterval. Then the\nright Riemann sum is de\ufb01ned as \u03b4 \ufffdn\nk=1 f(xk). The Riemann\nsum provides an approximation of the integral. Indeed,\n\ufffd b\na\nf(x) dx = lim\nn\u2192\u221e \u03b4\nn\n\ufffd\nk=1\nf(xk).\n(3)\nThe Riemann sums can be quickly calculated on a computer\nproviding a simple, yet effective approach to calculating\nintegrals numerically. Other popular integral approximation\nmethods include the trapezoid rule and the Simpson\u2019s rule.\nD. Additional considerations\nThe above discussion about numerical methods for cal-\nculating limits, derivatives, and integrals is easily extended\nto multivariate calculus. For instance, to \ufb01nd the partial\nderivative fx(a, b), we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate\nf(a+10\u2212k,b)\u2212f(a,b)\n10\u2212k\n. Many problems related to sequences and\nseries can similarly be solved using numerical techniques. In\nparticular, the convergence of a series can be deduced from its\npartial sums. By calculating the partial sums on the computer\nand observing the results, we can intuit the nature of the series.\nVectorization is an important aspect of numerical com-\nputing. Since the modern computer chips are optimized for\nmatrix multiplication, it is more ef\ufb01cient to employ vector\noperations. In particular, some algorithms based on for-loops\ncan be converted into vector operations resulting in higher\nef\ufb01ciency and speed. For instance, the Riemann sum can be\ncalculated with a single vector operation:\n\u03b4\nn\n\ufffd\nk=1\nf(xk) = \u03b4S\n\ufffd\nf(x)\n\ufffd\n,\n(4)\nwhere x = [x1, ..., xn] is the vector of endpoints, f(x) is\na vectorized function operation, and S is the vector func-\ntion which returns the sum of all the coordinates. Similarly,\nlimit calculations can be vectorized and made more ef\ufb01cient.\nVectorization is also useful in multi-variate calculus, where\noperations can be performed on a vector of variables.\nThe choice of the programming language for numerical\ncomputing requires careful consideration. There are several\nsuitable candidates for this purpose including Python, Java,\nC++, Matlab, and others. Based on our experience with\ndifferent programming languages, we recommend the use of\nPython. Python is currently the most popular programming\nlanguage on the planet. It has a simple and intuitive syntax\nmaking it easy to learn and apply. Python has libraries to\n\ufb01t any purpose including an extensive collection of libraries\nrelated to numerical computing. The basic Python libraries\nrelated to computing are NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy. More\nadvanced packages such as OR-Tools are also available for\noptimization tasks. Since Python is a universal programming\nlanguage, it can be used for almost any task. Thus, students\nwho learn Python in their mathematics courses can employ\nit in their other courses. In addition, numerical computing\nimplemented in Python can be connected to other applications.\n",
    "V. CONCLUSION\nAlthough the classical approach to teaching mathematics\nis still relevant for certain student cohorts, it is outdated for\nengineering students. Modern engineering is increasingly re-\nliant on computing [9], [22]. Therefore, universities must equip\nthe student with appropriate computing skills. In particular,\nmathematics courses must be revised to include numerical\ncomputing content.\nGiven the ef\ufb01ciency of computer-based calculations, numer-\nical computing provides a convenient approach to problem\nsolving in engineering mathematics. It can be integrated into\nthe existing curriculum with little hassle and cost. In this paper,\nwe proposed a framework for integrating numerical computing\ninto the existing mathematics curriculum. We demonstrated\nhow numerical approaches can be used some of the most\ncommon problems encountered in calculus. The proposed\nframework can be customized by individual universities to \ufb01t\ntheir special needs.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Abdul Majid, M., Huneiti, Z., Balachandran, W., & Al-Naafa, M.
